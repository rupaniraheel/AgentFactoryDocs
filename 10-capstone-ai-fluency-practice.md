# Capstone: AI Fluency in Practice

You've spent nine lessons developing AI Fluency skills. You learned when to delegate tasks to AI. You mastered describing your intent with precision. You practiced discerning quality through iterative refinement. You understood the diligence required for responsible AI collaboration.

Now comes the synthesis: **Design a system that demonstrates ALL of these skills working together.**

This isn't an implementation exercise. You won't write code. Instead, you'll write a **specification**—a document so clear and complete that another developer could build the system from your spec alone. This is the ultimate test of AI Fluency: Can you articulate intent so precisely that execution becomes straightforward?

## The Challenge: Context-Aware Development Tool

Your capstone project: Write a complete specification for a **context-aware development tool** that helps developers maintain AI session quality across complex, multi-day projects.

This tool addresses a real problem. Developers working with AI coding assistants face these challenges:

- **Context degradation**: Session quality drops as conversations grow long
- **Session boundaries**: Knowledge doesn't transfer between sessions
- **Manual overhead**: Developers manually re-explain project context repeatedly
- **Quality inconsistency**: Some sessions produce excellent results; others struggle

Your specification will describe a system that solves these problems automatically.

## 4D Alignment Requirements

Your specification must explicitly demonstrate each D:

| D | What Your Spec Must Include |
|---|---|
| **Delegation** | Which tasks the tool handles vs. which remain with the developer |
| **Description** | How the tool communicates with AI (prompt patterns, context structures) |
| **Discernment** | How the tool evaluates session quality and triggers interventions |
| **Diligence** | How the tool ensures accurate, responsible, transparent operation |

Each section of your spec should reference which D(s) it addresses.

## Specification Structure

Use this structure for your specification document:

### 1. Intent (Delegation Focus)

**What you're writing**: 1-2 paragraphs explaining WHAT the tool does and WHY developers need it.

**4D Alignment**: This section answers Delegation questions:
- What should the tool handle autonomously?
- What should remain under developer control?
- What's the benefit of this delegation?

**Example (NOT for copying—write your own)**:

> **Intent**: A system that monitors AI development sessions, automatically applies context management strategies, and maintains project continuity across session boundaries—all without manual intervention.
>
> **Developer benefit**: Zero re-explanation of project context in new sessions. Automatic quality maintenance during long sessions.

### 2. Success Criteria (Discernment Focus)

**What you're writing**: 4-6 measurable, falsifiable criteria that define success.

**4D Alignment**: This section applies Discernment—defining HOW to evaluate quality:
- What numbers indicate success?
- What can be tested/verified?
- What would failure look like?

**Pattern for writing criteria**:
- Start with a percentage or number
- Describe what's being measured
- Make it falsifiable (can prove true or false)

**Weak vs. Strong Criteria**:

| Weak (Unfalsifiable) | Strong (Measurable) |
|---|---|
| "Developers are happier" | "80% of sessions maintain context utilization under 70%" |
| "Improves productivity" | "Zero manual re-explanation in new sessions after memory file load" |
| "Works reliably" | "Memory files capture 90% of architectural decisions automatically" |

### 3. Functional Requirements (Description Focus)

**What you're writing**: 4-6 observable behaviors the tool must exhibit.

**4D Alignment**: This section defines Description patterns:
- What triggers each behavior?
- What information does the tool communicate?
- How does context flow through the system?

**Structure each requirement**:

```
### Requirement N: [Name]

**When**: [Trigger condition]
**What**: [Observable action]
**Measure**: [How to verify]
**Output**: [What the user sees/receives]
```

**Requirements to consider**:
- Context monitoring and alerting
- Automatic checkpoint creation
- Session handoff management
- Memory file updates
- Quality assessment and intervention

### 4. System Architecture (All 4Ds Integration)

**What you're writing**: Description of 4-6 components and their interactions.

**4D Alignment**: Show how each component embodies one or more Ds:
- Which components handle Delegation decisions?
- Which implement Description patterns?
- Which perform Discernment evaluation?
- Which enforce Diligence requirements?

**For each component, describe**:
- **Responsibility**: What single thing does it do?
- **Inputs**: What information does it receive?
- **Outputs**: What does it produce?
- **4D Role**: Which D(s) does it implement?

**Do NOT include**:
- Implementation details (no Python, no databases)
- Technology choices (no "use Redis for caching")
- API endpoints or data schemas

### 5. Memory File Design (Description + Diligence Focus)

**What you're writing**: Specification for persistent memory files that survive session boundaries.

**Files to design**:
- `CLAUDE.md`: Project configuration and preferences
- `architecture.md`: System design decisions
- `decisions.md`: Accumulated architectural decisions (ADRs)

**For each file, specify**:
- **When loaded**: Start of session? On-demand?
- **When updated**: End of session? On specific events?
- **What it contains**: Structure and sections
- **Conflict resolution**: What if file changed externally?

**Diligence requirement**: How do you ensure memory files remain accurate? What validation occurs?

### 6. Multi-Session Workflow (All 4Ds)

**What you're writing**: How the tool manages work across multiple sessions.

**Describe**:
- **Session start**: What context loads automatically?
- **During session**: What monitoring and intervention occurs?
- **Session end**: What gets saved for next session?
- **Session handoff**: How does knowledge transfer?

**Show 4D integration**:
- Delegation: What happens automatically vs. manually?
- Description: What context is communicated to AI?
- Discernment: How is session quality evaluated?
- Diligence: How is continuity verified?

### 7. Diligence Considerations

**What you're writing**: How the tool operates responsibly.

**Address**:
- **Accuracy**: How does the tool ensure information is correct?
- **Transparency**: How does the developer know what the tool did?
- **Verification**: How can decisions be audited?
- **Limitations**: What does the tool explicitly NOT do?

### 8. Non-Goals

**What you're writing**: Explicit boundaries—what the tool does NOT do.

**Why this matters**: Scope creep kills specifications. Clear non-goals prevent feature bloat.

**Pattern**: "The tool does NOT [X] because [reason]."

## Self-Evaluation Rubric

Use this rubric to evaluate your specification before submission:

### Completeness (25 points)

| Criterion | Points | Self-Score |
|---|---|---|
| Intent section present and clear | 5 | |
| 4+ measurable success criteria | 5 | |
| 4+ functional requirements with triggers | 5 | |
| 4+ components with responsibilities defined | 5 | |
| Memory file design complete | 5 | |

### 4D Alignment (25 points)

| Criterion | Points | Self-Score |
|---|---|---|
| Delegation decisions explicit | 5 | |
| Description patterns documented | 5 | |
| Discernment criteria measurable | 5 | |
| Diligence considerations included | 5 | |
| Each section references its D(s) | 5 | |

### Quality (25 points)

| Criterion | Points | Self-Score |
|---|---|---|
| No implementation details (zero code) | 5 | |
| All criteria are falsifiable | 5 | |
| Could another developer build from this? | 5 | |
| 500+ words total | 5 | |
| Non-goals defined | 5 | |

### AI Collaboration (25 points)

| Criterion | Points | Self-Score |
|---|---|---|
| AI assisted in drafting | 5 | |
| Multiple refinement iterations occurred | 5 | |

| Collaboration documented | 5 | |

**Scoring Guide**:
- 90-100: Exceeds expectations—specification is implementation-ready
- 75-89: Meets expectations—minor clarifications needed
- 60-74: Approaching expectations—significant gaps to address
- Below 60: Needs revision—fundamental elements missing

## Validation Questions

Before considering your spec complete, answer these questions:

**Delegation Validation**:
- [ ] Have I clearly stated what the tool does automatically?
- [ ] Have I clearly stated what remains under developer control?
- [ ] Is the delegation boundary defensible?

**Description Validation**:
- [ ] Would AI receive sufficient context from my design?
- [ ] Are my prompting patterns clear and reproducible?
- [ ] Have I specified what information flows where?

**Discernment Validation**:
- [ ] Can every success criterion be tested?
- [ ] Would I recognize success vs. failure?
- [ ] Are my thresholds (percentages, numbers) realistic?

**Diligence Validation**:
- [ ] How does my design ensure accuracy?
- [ ] How does my design maintain transparency?
- [ ] What limitations have I explicitly acknowledged?

## Try With AI

**Phase 1: Initial Specification Draft**

Start your specification with AI assistance:

```
I'm writing a specification for a context-aware development tool.
The tool should help developers maintain AI session quality across
multi-day projects.

Help me draft the Intent section. Ask me clarifying questions:
- What specific problems does this solve?
- Who uses it and when?
- What's the measurable benefit?

Guide me to write 1-2 paragraphs that explain WHAT the tool does
(not HOW it's built). No implementation details—focus on observable
behavior and developer benefit.
```

**What you're learning**: The Description-Discernment loop in action. You provide initial intent; AI asks clarifying questions; you refine until the description is precise.

---

**Phase 2: Success Criteria Development**

Develop measurable criteria:

```
I've drafted the Intent section for my context-aware tool. Now help
me develop Success Criteria.

For each criterion I propose, challenge me:
- Is this measurable with a specific number?
- Is this falsifiable (can prove true or false)?
- Am I describing an outcome or an implementation?

Start with these rough ideas and help me refine them:
- Sessions should stay focused
- Context should transfer between sessions
- Developers shouldn't repeat themselves

Guide me to convert each into measurable, falsifiable criteria.
```

**What you're learning**: Discernment applied to your own work. AI helps you identify vague language and convert it to testable criteria.

---

**Phase 3: Complete Specification Review**

Validate your complete specification:

```
Here's my complete specification for a context-aware development tool:

[Paste your entire specification here]

Review this as if you're a developer who must build this system
without any other context. Identify:

1. AMBIGUITIES: What questions would you need to ask?
2. MISSING DETAILS: What's undefined?
3. IMPLEMENTATION LEAKAGE: Where did I accidentally prescribe HOW?
4. 4D GAPS: Which D is weakest in my spec?

Be thorough. A good specification should leave no questions.
```

**What you're learning**: Self-evaluation through external perspective. AI simulates the reader who must understand your intent without your context.

---

**Safety Note**: Your specification describes a hypothetical tool. If you later decide to build it, remember that any tool that monitors developer activity or modifies files should include user consent, transparency about actions taken, and the ability to disable monitoring. Design with developer trust in mind.
