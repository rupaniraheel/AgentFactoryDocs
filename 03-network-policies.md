# NetworkPolicies for Zero-Trust Traffic Control

In March 2023, a security researcher discovered that a popular cloud provider's managed Kubernetes service had no NetworkPolicy enforcement by default. Pods in one tenant's namespace could freely communicate with pods in other tenants' namespaces. The vulnerability went undetected for months because Kubernetes allows all traffic by default—and most teams never lock it down.

Your Task API running in Kubernetes can currently reach every other pod in the cluster. An attacker who compromises your pod gains lateral movement to databases, secret stores, and control plane components. NetworkPolicies transform your cluster from an open network into a zero-trust environment where pods communicate only with explicitly permitted services.

This lesson teaches you to implement the most critical security pattern: **default deny first, then explicit allows**. Without this pattern, your cluster security is theater.

---

## Prerequisite: Install Calico CNI

Docker Desktop's default CNI does not enforce NetworkPolicies. You must install Calico before any policies take effect.

**Why Calico is required:**

| CNI | NetworkPolicy Support |
|-----|----------------------|
| Default Docker Desktop | No enforcement (policies ignored) |
| Calico | Full enforcement |
| Cilium | Full enforcement |

Install Calico with a single command:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/projectcalico/calico/v3.26.1/manifests/calico.yaml
```

**Output:**

```
configmap/calico-config created
customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/bgpconfigurations.crd.projectcalico.org created
...
daemonset.apps/calico-node created
deployment.apps/calico-kube-controllers created
```

Wait for Calico pods to become ready:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n kube-system -l k8s-app=calico-node --watch
```

**Output:**

```
NAME                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
calico-node-abc12   1/1     Running   0          2m
```

Once all calico-node pods show `Running`, NetworkPolicies are enforced cluster-wide.

---

## The Default Deny Pattern

**Critical principle: Default deny must be your first NetworkPolicy.**

When you apply a NetworkPolicy that selects pods, Kubernetes switches those pods from "allow all" to "deny all except explicitly allowed." You control this with `policyTypes`.

### Default Deny All Traffic

Create `default-deny.yaml` in your Task API namespace:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: default-deny-all
  namespace: task-api
spec:
  podSelector: {}  # Applies to ALL pods in namespace
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  - Egress
```

**Output (after applying):**

```bash
kubectl apply -f default-deny.yaml
```

```
networkpolicy.networking.k8s.io/default-deny-all created
```

**What just happened:**

- `podSelector: {}` selects every pod in the `task-api` namespace
- `policyTypes: [Ingress, Egress]` denies both inbound and outbound traffic
- No `ingress` or `egress` rules means zero allowed traffic

Your Task API pods can no longer reach anything—including DNS.

---

## The DNS Edge Case (CRITICAL)

**Warning: Without a DNS allow rule, service discovery breaks completely.**

After applying default deny, try to resolve a service name from your Task API pod:

```bash
kubectl exec -n task-api deploy/task-api -- nslookup kubernetes.default
```

**Output:**

```
;; connection timed out; no servers could be reached
command terminated with exit code 1
```

Service discovery fails because pods cannot reach CoreDNS in kube-system. This breaks:

- Database connections (`postgres.database.svc.cluster.local`)
- Inter-service calls (`auth-service.auth.svc.cluster.local`)
- Any hostname resolution

### Allow DNS Egress

Create `allow-dns.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-dns-egress
  namespace: task-api
spec:
  podSelector: {}  # All pods in namespace
  policyTypes:
  - Egress
  egress:
  - to:
    - namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          kubernetes.io/metadata.name: kube-system
    ports:
    - protocol: UDP
      port: 53
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 53
```

**Output:**

```bash
kubectl apply -f allow-dns.yaml
```

```
networkpolicy.networking.k8s.io/allow-dns-egress created
```

Now verify DNS resolution works:

```bash
kubectl exec -n task-api deploy/task-api -- nslookup kubernetes.default
```

**Output:**

```
Server:    10.96.0.10
Address:   10.96.0.10#53

Name:   kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local
Address: 10.96.0.1
```

**Why this works:**

| Element | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `namespaceSelector` with `kubernetes.io/metadata.name: kube-system` | Targets only CoreDNS namespace |
| Port 53 UDP | Standard DNS queries |
| Port 53 TCP | Large DNS responses that exceed UDP size |

**Common mistake**: Using `podSelector` instead of `namespaceSelector` for DNS. CoreDNS pods have specific labels, but targeting by namespace is more reliable across Kubernetes versions.

---

## Allow Ingress from Envoy Gateway

Your Task API receives traffic from the Envoy Gateway (configured in Chapter 56). Allow this ingress:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-gateway-ingress
  namespace: task-api
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: task-api
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  ingress:
  - from:
    - namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          kubernetes.io/metadata.name: envoy-gateway-system
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 8000
```

**Output:**

```bash
kubectl apply -f allow-gateway-ingress.yaml
```

```
networkpolicy.networking.k8s.io/allow-gateway-ingress created
```

**Why namespace selection matters:**

If you used `podSelector` without `namespaceSelector`, the rule would only match pods in the same namespace as your Task API. Gateway pods exist in a different namespace (`envoy-gateway-system`), so you must use `namespaceSelector` to cross namespace boundaries.

---

## Allow Egress to Specific Services

Your Task API needs to reach:
- PostgreSQL database (for persistence)
- Redis (for caching)

Create explicit egress rules:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-database-egress
  namespace: task-api
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: task-api
  policyTypes:
  - Egress
  egress:
  - to:
    - namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          kubernetes.io/metadata.name: database
      podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          app: postgres
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 5432
  - to:
    - namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          kubernetes.io/metadata.name: cache
      podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          app: redis
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 6379
```

**Output:**

```bash
kubectl apply -f allow-database-egress.yaml
```

```
networkpolicy.networking.k8s.io/allow-database-egress created
```

**Traffic matrix after all policies:**

| Source | Destination | Allowed? |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| Any pod | Task API :8000 | No (except gateway) |
| Envoy Gateway | Task API :8000 | Yes |
| Task API | CoreDNS :53 | Yes |
| Task API | Postgres :5432 | Yes |
| Task API | Redis :6379 | Yes |
| Task API | Any other service | No |
| External | Task API | No (no ingress rule) |

---

## Verification with Test Pod

The only way to confirm NetworkPolicies work is to test them. Deploy a test pod and attempt unauthorized traffic.

### Deploy Test Pod

```bash
kubectl run test-pod \
  -n task-api \
  --image=curlimages/curl:latest \
  --command -- sleep infinity
```

**Output:**

```
pod/test-pod created
```

### Test Blocked Traffic

Try to reach Task API from the test pod:

```bash
kubectl exec -n task-api test-pod -- curl -s --connect-timeout 3 http://task-api:8000/health
```

**Output:**

```
command terminated with exit code 28
```

Exit code 28 means connection timeout—the NetworkPolicy blocked the traffic.

### Test Allowed Traffic (Simulated Gateway)

To verify gateway traffic works, temporarily add a label that matches your ingress policy:

```bash
# This demonstrates the concept - in production, only gateway pods have these labels
kubectl label ns task-api kubernetes.io/metadata.name=envoy-gateway-system --dry-run=client -o yaml
```

In production, only pods from the `envoy-gateway-system` namespace can reach your Task API on port 8000.

### Cleanup Test Pod

```bash
kubectl delete pod test-pod -n task-api
```

**Output:**

```
pod "test-pod" deleted
```

```bash
kubectl apply -f task-api-network-policies.yaml
```

**Output:**

```
networkpolicy.networking.k8s.io/default-deny-all created
networkpolicy.networking.k8s.io/allow-dns-egress created
networkpolicy.networking.k8s.io/allow-gateway-ingress created
networkpolicy.networking.k8s.io/allow-database-egress created
```

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Symptom | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Forgot DNS allow | All service discovery fails | Add `allow-dns-egress` policy immediately after default deny |
| Used `podSelector` for cross-namespace | Traffic still blocked | Use `namespaceSelector` for pods in other namespaces |
| Missing Calico | Policies have no effect | Install Calico CNI before creating policies |
| Wrong port in egress | Connection timeouts | Verify target service port (not container port) |

## Reflect on Your Skill

Test your `cloud-security` skill against what you learned:

```
Using my cloud-security skill, generate NetworkPolicies for a new
microservice that needs to:
- Accept traffic only from the API gateway
- Connect to a PostgreSQL database in another namespace
- Make external HTTPS calls to api.openai.com
```

**Evaluation questions:**

1. Does your skill include default-deny as the FIRST policy?
2. Does your skill automatically include the DNS allow rule?
3. Does your skill handle cross-namespace traffic correctly with `namespaceSelector`?
4. Does your skill warn about the Calico/CNI requirement?

If any answers are "no," update your skill with the patterns from this lesson.

## Try With AI

Test your understanding of NetworkPolicy design and troubleshooting.

**Prompt 1:**

```
Generate a default-deny NetworkPolicy for a namespace called "payments"
that handles credit card processing. Include appropriate DNS egress rules.
```

**What you're learning:** Whether you can apply the default-deny + DNS pattern to a new namespace. Notice if the generated policy includes both UDP and TCP for port 53, and whether it correctly targets kube-system for CoreDNS.

**Prompt 2:**

```
My pods can't resolve hostnames after I applied a default-deny policy.
I added a DNS allow rule but it still doesn't work. The rule targets
pods with label app=coredns in the default namespace. What's wrong?
```

**What you're learning:** Common debugging patterns for NetworkPolicy. The issue is that CoreDNS runs in kube-system (not default) and the correct approach uses `namespaceSelector` rather than `podSelector` alone. This is the most common NetworkPolicy mistake.

**Prompt 3:**

```
Design NetworkPolicies for a multi-service architecture:
- Frontend (receives external traffic via ingress controller)
- API (receives traffic from frontend, calls backend)
- Backend (receives traffic from API, connects to database)
- Database (receives traffic only from backend)

Use least-privilege principles.
```

**What you're learning:** How to design a complete NetworkPolicy architecture for a realistic application. Each service should have its own ingress/egress policies, creating a defense-in-depth traffic matrix.

:::warning Security Reminder
Always test NetworkPolicies in a development namespace before applying to production. A misconfigured egress policy can break your application's ability to reach databases, external APIs, or even DNS. Use `kubectl exec` with curl or nslookup to verify connectivity after each policy change.
