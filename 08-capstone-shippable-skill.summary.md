### Core Concept
Build a specification-first Digital FTE that orchestrates intelligence from Lessons 1-7. Six phases: Domain specification, Skill composition, Implementation, Acceptance testing, Production packaging, Business positioning. Product, not exercise.

### Key Mental Models
- **Spec → Implementation → Validation → Packaging → Monetization**: Full product lifecycle
- **Customer problem, not technology**: Intent describes pain, not features
- **Composition over invention**: Reuse tested components from Lessons 1-7
- **Acceptance tests before implementation**: Prove it works, don't assume

### Critical Patterns
- Intent template: "[Company type] needs [outcome] but [friction]. Skill [solution] enabling [result]."
- Success criteria: Accuracy %, Speed, Reliability, Completeness, Safety, Integration, Learning
- Architecture mapping: Data ingestion (L4) → Analysis (L6) → Coordination (L7) → Output
- Monetization models: Subscription, Success-fee, License—choose based on value capture

### AI Collaboration Keys
- Prompt 1: Sharpen specification until AI can implement without clarification
- Prompt 2: Design composition architecture with data flow and error recovery
- Prompt 3: Implementation while validating each decision
- Prompt 4: Gap analysis when tests reveal spec/implementation misalignment
- Prompt 5: Business positioning for monetization

### Common Mistakes
- Vague specification requiring clarification loops
- Building from scratch instead of composing
- Skipping acceptance testing before production claim
- No business positioning (skill without customer)

### Connections
- **Builds on**: Full Workflow Orchestration (Lesson 7)
- **Leads to**: Chapter 40 (FastAPI for Agents) / Real-world deployment
