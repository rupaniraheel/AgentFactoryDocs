### Core Concept
Subscription and Success Fee are the two most direct paths to Digital FTE revenue, each with distinct tradeoffs: Subscription offers predictable recurring revenue but requires customer retention, while Success Fee aligns incentives (you only win if they win) but requires measurable outcomes.

### Key Mental Models
- **Subscription Economics**: $1,500/month price - $600/month cost = $900/month margin per client; 50 clients = $45,000/month recurring revenue
- **Success Fee Economics**: Zero upfront cost to client, commission on measurable results; proves value before asking for recurring commitment
- **Hybrid Path**: Start Success Fee to prove value (months 0-3), upgrade to Subscription once trust is established (month 4+)

### Critical Patterns
- Choose Subscription when success equals "agent is running and available" (easy to measure)
- Choose Success Fee when success equals "measurable business outcomes" and you're confident in your solution
- Match monetization model to client cash flow patterns (predictable revenue = Subscription, variable outcomes = Success Fee)
- Position Subscription as "managed service, hands-off" vs Success Fee as "risk-free, results-based partnership"

### Common Mistakes
- Choosing Success Fee for domains where success is hard to measure independently (e.g., code review—did you prevent a bug or reject valid code?)
- Starting with Subscription when client needs proof first—Success Fee builds trust faster for skeptical buyers
- Forgetting that Success Fee requires 2-3 months of tuning before you earn meaningful revenue
