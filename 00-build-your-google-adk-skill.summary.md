### Core Concept
Before learning Google ADK, you own a working skill built from official documentation. Clone the skills-lab, prompt Claude to create your google-adk skill via Context7, and learn to improve it throughout the chapter.

### Key Mental Models
- **Skill-first learning**: Build the asset before studying theory—rest of chapter teaches what the skill knows
- **Documentation-grounded**: Context7 fetches official docs, not memory-based assumptions
- **Ownership over knowledge**: You graduate with a sellable skill, not just understanding

### Critical Patterns
- Clone `claude-code-skills-lab` fresh each chapter
- Prompt: "Using your skill creator skill create a new skill for Google ADK... Use context7 skill to study official documentation"
- Skill appears at `.claude/skills/google-adk/`

### AI Collaboration Keys
- Let Claude ask clarifying questions (workflow types, tool patterns, evaluation needs)
- Trust Context7 for current API patterns over training data

### Common Mistakes
- Assuming prior state from other chapters (always clone fresh)
- Skipping the skill creation step and jumping to lessons
- Building skill from memory instead of official documentation

### Connections
- **Builds on**: Skills-lab infrastructure from previous chapters
- **Leads to**: ADK Fundamentals (Lesson 1) where you test and improve your skill
