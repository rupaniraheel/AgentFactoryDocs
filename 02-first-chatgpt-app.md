# Your First Widget

Theory from Lesson 1 gave you the mental model. Now let's get something working. In the next 45 minutes, you'll build a ChatGPT App that displays "Hello, World!" in a styled widget—and you'll do it in under 50 lines of code.

The goal isn't to understand every detail yet. The goal is to see a widget render in ChatGPT. Once that works, you have a foundation to build on. Each subsequent lesson adds one feature to this widget until you have a complete TaskManager.

## Project Setup

Create a new directory for your ChatGPT App:

```bash
mkdir taskmanager-widget
cd taskmanager-widget
uv init
```

Add dependencies:

```bash
uv add "mcp[cli]>=1.9.2" "uvicorn>=0.32.0"
```

**Output:**
```
Resolved 12 packages in 1.2s
Installed 12 packages in 50ms
 + mcp==1.9.2
 + uvicorn==0.32.0
 ...
```

## The Minimal Server

Here's the entire server—under 50 lines. Create `main.py`:

```python
import mcp.types as types
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP

# The magic MIME type that triggers widget rendering
MIME_TYPE = "text/html+skybridge"

# Your widget HTML - simple and styled
WIDGET_HTML = '''<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <style>
    body {
      font-family: system-ui, sans-serif;
      background: linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea, #764ba2);
      min-height: 150px;
      display: flex;
      align-items: center;
      justify-content: center;
      margin: 0;
    }
    .card {
      background: white;
      padding: 24px 48px;
      border-radius: 12px;
      box-shadow: 0 4px 20px rgba(0,0,0,0.15);
      text-align: center;
    }
    h1 { margin: 0; color: #333; }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <div class="card">
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>Your first ChatGPT App widget</p>
  </div>
</body>
</html>'''

mcp = FastMCP("TaskManager")

@mcp.tool()
def show_greeting() -> types.CallToolResult:
    """Display a greeting widget."""
    return types.CallToolResult(
        content=[types.TextContent(type="text", text="Showing greeting")],
        _meta={
            "openai.com/widget": types.EmbeddedResource(
                type="resource",
                resource=types.TextResourceContents(
                    uri="ui://greeting",
                    mimeType=MIME_TYPE,
                    text=WIDGET_HTML,
                )
            )
        }
    )

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import uvicorn
    app = mcp.sse_app()
    uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8001)
```


### What Makes This Work

Three things turn this MCP server into a ChatGPT App:

1. **`MIME_TYPE = "text/html+skybridge"`** — This tells ChatGPT "render this as a widget, not text"

2. **`_meta` with `"openai.com/widget"`** — This attaches the widget HTML to the tool response

3. **`EmbeddedResource`** — This packages the HTML with its MIME type

Without any of these three, you get text output instead of a widget.

## Running the Server

Start your server:

```bash
uv run main.py
```

**Output:**
```
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8001 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
INFO:     Started server process [12345]
```

Your server is running locally. But ChatGPT needs a public URL.

## Exposing with ngrok

In a second terminal, create a tunnel:

```bash
ngrok http 8001
```

**Output:**
```
Forwarding    https://abc123.ngrok-free.app -> http://localhost:8001
```

Copy that `https://...ngrok-free.app` URL. Your MCP endpoint is:

```
https://abc123.ngrok-free.app/mcp
```

Note: The URL changes each time you restart ngrok (on the free plan).

## Registering in ChatGPT

1. Go to [chatgpt.com](https://chatgpt.com)
2. Click Settings (gear icon) → Toggle **Developer mode** ON
3. Click **Create app**
4. Enter:
   - **Name**: TaskManager
   - **MCP Server URL**: `https://abc123.ngrok-free.app/mcp` (your ngrok URL + `/mcp`)
   - **Authentication**: No Auth
5. Click **Create**

Your app should show "Connected" status.

## Testing Your Widget

1. Start a new chat
2. Type `@TaskManager` to select your app
3. Say: "Show me a greeting"

**Output:**

You should see your purple gradient card with "Hello, World!" displayed directly in the conversation.

If it works—congratulations. You've built your first ChatGPT App.

## Troubleshooting

**Widget shows "Loading..." forever**
- Check that `MIME_TYPE` is exactly `"text/html+skybridge"`
- Verify `_meta` key is exactly `"openai.com/widget"`

**App shows "Disconnected"**
- ngrok URL may have changed—restart ngrok and update the app URL in ChatGPT settings

**Tool not appearing**
- Delete the app in ChatGPT and recreate it with the current ngrok URL

## What You Built

You now have:
- A FastMCP server running on port 8001
- A widget that renders in ChatGPT
- A development workflow (ngrok + Developer Mode)

This is your foundation. In the next lesson, you'll add a "Refresh" button that triggers new conversation turns.

## Try With AI

### Prompt 1: Add a Name Parameter

```
Modify my show_greeting tool to accept a "name" parameter.
The widget should display "Hello, [name]!" instead of "Hello, World!".
Use window.openai?.toolOutput to read the name in the widget JavaScript.
```

**What you're learning:** How data flows from tool parameters through `structuredContent` to the widget via `window.openai.toolOutput`. This pattern is essential for the TaskManager.

### Prompt 2: Change the Style

```
Update my widget's CSS to use a different color gradient (green to teal instead of purple). Also add a subtle animation when the widget appears.
```

**What you're learning:** Widget styling capabilities within the iframe sandbox. All CSS must be inline since external stylesheets don't reliably load.

### Prompt 3: Understand the MIME Type

```
Explain why text/html+skybridge is required for ChatGPT App widgets. What happens if I use text/html instead? Why did OpenAI create a custom MIME type?
```

**What you're learning:** The architectural decision behind widget rendering. Understanding this helps debug when widgets fail to appear.

**Safety Note**: Your ngrok tunnel is publicly accessible. Don't include real credentials or sensitive data in your test server.
