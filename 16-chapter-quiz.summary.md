### Core Concept
20-question assessment covering all 8 unique Claude Agent SDK features. Bloom's distribution: 5 Remember, 5 Understand, 5 Apply, 3 Analyze, 2 Evaluate. Mastery threshold: 18-20 (90%+) ready for production Digital FTEs.

### Key Mental Models
- **Feature recall**: rewindFiles, canUseTool, settingSources, slash commands, checkpointing, sessions, cost tracking, hooks, compaction
- **Architectural decisions**: When to use each permission mode, hosting pattern, tool design
- **Production readiness**: Security, persistence, recovery, billing, monitoring all validated

### Critical Patterns
- Quiz tests feature identification, configuration, implementation, and architectural evaluation
- Questions progress from Remember (what is X?) through Evaluate (which approach for this scenario?)
- Scoring guide maps to readiness levels and recommended next steps

### AI Collaboration Keys
- Use quiz to identify gaps, then return to specific lessons
- Build simple agents first (3-4 features) before complex integration
- Master one feature at a time for below-12 scores

### Common Mistakes
- Skipping quiz and proceeding to build without validating understanding
- Not reviewing explanations even when answering correctly
- Attempting production agents without mastery-level scores

### Connections
- **Builds on**: TaskManager Capstone (Lesson 15)
- **Leads to**: Chapter 37 (MCP Fundamentals)
