### Core Concept
Skills encode decision-making frameworks (Persona, Questions, Principles) that activate reasoning about context, enabling consistent architectural decisions across future projects without prescriptive templates or cookie-cutter code.

### Key Mental Models
- **Intelligence Reuse**: Skills transfer thinking patterns, not just code; they adapt to new contexts
- **Persona as Stance**: Strong personas activate architectural reasoning ("think about components, coupling, lifecycle")
- **Questions Force Analysis**: Decision-forcing questions drive context-specific analysis, not pattern retrieval
- **Principles Guide Judgment**: Principles explain WHY behind decisions, enabling judgment in new situations

### Critical Patterns
- Persona: Describes cognitive stance, not generic expertise
- Questions: 8-10 decision-forcing prompts about YOUR project context
- Principles: 10-12 frameworks explaining WHY (not just WHAT)
- File location: `.claude/skills/helm-chart-architect/SKILL.md`

### AI Collaboration Keys
- Test skill by invoking on new project scenario
- Validate skill handles edge cases (constraints, limitations)
- Check for consistent guidance despite different phrasings

### Common Mistakes
- Weak persona ("you are an expert") instead of cognitive stance
- Questions that retrieve patterns instead of forcing analysis
- Principles that state facts instead of explaining frameworks

### Connections
- **Builds on**: Capstone experience provides content for skill encoding
- **Leads to**: Future projects invoke this skill for consistent architectural decisions
