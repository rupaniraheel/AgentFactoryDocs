### Core Concept
Production AI agent architecture integrates **concurrent I/O** (TaskGroup for API fetching) with **parallel CPU** (InterpreterPoolExecutor for inference), achieving 2-3x speedup over sequential execution through overlapped execution patterns.

### Key Mental Models
- **Hybrid execution timeline**: Concurrent fetch (~3s for longest source) + parallel inference (~2s across cores) = ~5s total vs ~12.5s sequential
- **Stage overlap**: Start processing results as they arrive; don't wait for all I/O to complete before CPU work begins
- **Graceful degradation**: System returns partial results when sources fail—2 of 3 successful is better than total failure
- **Critical path analysis**: Total time = max(fetch_times) + max(process_times), not sum of all operations

### Critical Patterns
1. **TaskGroup orchestration**: `async with asyncio.TaskGroup() as tg:` creates all fetch tasks, structured concurrency ensures cleanup
2. **Executor bridge**: `loop.run_in_executor(executor, cpu_func, data)` connects async code to parallel CPU execution
3. **Layered timeouts**: Individual source timeout (5s) + overall system timeout (15s) prevents hung operations
4. **Result aggregation**: Collect successful results + error messages + timing metadata into comprehensive response

### AI Collaboration Keys
- Ask AI to trace request flow through TaskGroup → InterpreterPoolExecutor → aggregation stages
- Use AI to identify optimization opportunities: early timeout, caching, request prioritization
- Collaborate on error handling strategy: when to retry vs fail fast vs return partial results
- Request AI architecture review for production readiness

### Common Mistakes
- Waiting for all fetches before starting any processing (misses pipeline optimization opportunity)
- Not applying timeouts to external operations (one slow source hangs entire system)
- Treating any failure as total failure (graceful degradation is production standard)
- Using threading instead of InterpreterPoolExecutor for CPU work (GIL limits parallelism)
- Sequential executor submission (defeats parallelism—submit all tasks before awaiting results)

### Connections
- **Prerequisites**: TaskGroup (L2), timeouts (L3), InterpreterPoolExecutor (L4), hybrid patterns (L5)
- **Synthesis**: Capstone integrates ALL chapter concepts into single production-ready system
- **Enables**: Multi-agent orchestration systems, production AI pipelines, scalable concurrent architectures
