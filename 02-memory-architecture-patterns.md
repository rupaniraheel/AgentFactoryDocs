# Memory Architecture Patterns

When we designed the first personal computers, we looked to the human brain for inspiration. Working memory, long-term storage, recall mechanisms—these cognitive science concepts shaped computer architecture. The same is happening now with AI agents.

Effective agent memory isn't one thing—it's a system of specialized memory types, each serving a different purpose. Understanding these types helps you design agents that remember the right things in the right ways.

This lesson introduces five memory types and shows how they work together. We'll also look at how systems like Letta (formerly MemGPT) implement a two-tier architecture that mirrors how the brain handles in-focus vs. background information.

## Five Types of Agent Memory

Cognitive science distinguishes several memory systems in the human brain. Agent systems have parallel concepts:

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                            AGENT MEMORY SYSTEM                              │
├────────────────┬─────────────────┬─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Conversation  │    Working      │            Long-term                    │

│                │                 │                                         │

│                │                 │  │     (facts & entities)          │   │
│  Volatile      │  Task-scoped    │  └─────────────────────────────────┘   │
│  (session)     │  (cleared)      │         Persistent                      │
└────────────────┴─────────────────┴─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 1. Conversation Memory (Short-term)

**What it is:** The immediate context of the current conversation—recent messages between user and agent.

**Human analogy:** Working memory in a conversation. You remember what was just said, but after a day you might forget the exact wording.

**Characteristics:**
- Ephemeral: exists only during active session
- Typically a sliding window of recent turns
- Automatically included in LLM context
- Lost when session ends

**Example:**
```
Conversation Memory (last 5 turns):
1. User: "Add 'Review PR #123' to my tasks"
2. Agent: "Added 'Review PR #123' with normal priority"
3. User: "Make it high priority"
4. Agent: "Updated to high priority"
5. User: "When is it due?"
```

**Best for:** Maintaining coherence within a single conversation session.

### 2. Working Memory

**What it is:** Active context about the current task being performed—goals, intermediate results, and state.

**Human analogy:** The mental workspace when solving a problem. You hold relevant pieces in mind while working.

**Characteristics:**
- Task-scoped: exists for duration of a task
- Cleared when task completes
- Holds current goal and progress
- More structured than conversation memory

**Example:**
```
Working Memory (current task):
{
  "goal": "Create weekly status report",
  "status": "in_progress",
  "steps_completed": [
    "Gathered task completions from last week",
    "Identified blockers"
  ],
  "current_step": "Drafting summary",
  "context": {
    "report_format": "bullet_points",
    "audience": "engineering_team"
  }
}
```

**Best for:** Multi-step tasks where the agent needs to track progress and intermediate state.

### 3. Long-term Memory

The umbrella term for persistent memories that survive across sessions. Subdivides into episodic and semantic memory.

### 4. Episodic Memory

**What it is:** Records of specific events and interactions—what happened, when, with whom.

**Human analogy:** Autobiographical memory. "Last Tuesday I met Sarah and we discussed the project deadline."

**Characteristics:**
- Time-stamped: knows when events occurred
- Sequential: can recall order of events
- Contextual: includes surrounding circumstances
- Decays over time (older = less detailed)

**Example:**
```
Episodic Memory:
[
  {
    "timestamp": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
    "event": "User asked about authentication patterns",
    "outcome": "Recommended OAuth 2.0 with PKCE",
    "user_reaction": "positive"
  },
  {
    "timestamp": "2025-01-17T14:00:00Z",
    "event": "User reported OAuth implementation issues",
    "outcome": "Debugged token refresh logic together",
    "resolution": "Fixed by adding retry mechanism"
  },
  {
    "timestamp": "2025-01-20T09:00:00Z",
    "event": "User confirmed OAuth working in production",
    "context": "Three-day project completed successfully"
  }
]
```

**Best for:** Building continuity across sessions. "Last time we discussed..." patterns.

### 5. Semantic Memory

**What it is:** Factual knowledge about entities and their relationships—general knowledge extracted from experiences.

**Human analogy:** General knowledge. You know Paris is in France without remembering when you learned it.

**Characteristics:**
- Entity-focused: people, projects, concepts
- Relationship-aware: how entities connect
- Abstracted: distilled from multiple episodes
- Relatively stable over time

**Example:**
```
Semantic Memory:
{
  "entities": {
    "Alex": {
      "type": "user",
      "role": "senior_engineer",
      "team": "platform",
      "preferences": ["morning_meetings", "detailed_docs"],
      "expertise": ["python", "kubernetes", "auth_systems"]
    },
    "Phoenix Project": {
      "type": "project",
      "status": "active",
      "deadline": "2025-01-31",
      "involves": ["auth-service", "user-service"],
      "owner": "Alex"
    }
  },
  "relationships": [
    {"from": "Alex", "relation": "owns", "to": "Phoenix Project"},
    {"from": "Phoenix Project", "relation": "uses", "to": "OAuth 2.0"}
  ]
}
```

**Best for:** Understanding context without explicit reminders. "The project" → Phoenix Project.

## Memory Type Comparison

| Memory Type | Persistence | Scope | Updates | Example Query |
|-------------|-------------|-------|---------|---------------|
| **Conversation** | Session | Current chat | Every turn | "What did they just say?" |
| **Working** | Task | Current task | Task progress | "What's our current goal?" |
| **Episodic** | Long-term | Past events | After interactions | "When did we last discuss auth?" |
| **Semantic** | Long-term | Entities/facts | When facts change | "What projects is Alex working on?" |

## The Two-Tier Architecture

Research systems like Letta (formerly MemGPT) formalize a two-tier memory model that's worth understanding conceptually.

### In-Context Memory (Core Memory)

Information that stays **always visible** to the LLM—included in every prompt without retrieval.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    IN-CONTEXT MEMORY                            │
│                                                                 │
│   ┌──────────────────────┐   ┌────────────────────────────┐    │
│   │    Persona Block     │   │      Human Block           │    │
│   │                      │   │                            │    │
│   │  "I am a task        │   │  "User: Alex               │    │
│   │   management agent   │   │   Role: Senior Engineer    │    │
│   │   that helps with    │   │   Preferences:             │    │
│   │   planning and       │   │   - Morning meetings       │    │
│   │   productivity."     │   │   - Bullet point format"   │    │
│   │                      │   │                            │    │
│   └──────────────────────┘   └────────────────────────────┘    │
│                                                                 │
│   Always visible to LLM. Updated via self-editing tools.        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Key insight:** Core memory is small but high-value. It's the agent's "active awareness" of who it is and who it's talking to.

### Out-of-Context Memory (External Memory)

Information stored **externally** and retrieved on demand—too large to keep in context but available when needed.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

│   │   Searchable storage for past conversations,            │   │
│   │   documents, facts, and extended context.               │   │

│   Retrieved on-demand. Not always visible.                      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Self-Editing Memory

A distinguishing feature of the Letta approach: agents don't just read from memory—they actively manage it.

**Memory Tools:**
- `memory_replace(block, old_text, new_text)` — Update specific content
- `memory_insert(block, text)` — Add new information
- `memory_rethink(block, new_content)` — Complete block rewrite

**Example behavior:**
```
User: "Actually, I prefer afternoon meetings now."

Agent thinks: "This contradicts the human block. I should update it."
Agent action: memory_replace("human", "Morning meetings", "Afternoon meetings")
Agent says: "Got it—I've updated my notes. Afternoon meetings from now on."
```

The agent maintains its own memory rather than relying on external systems to do it.

## Designing Memory for Task API

Let's apply these concepts to the Task API agent from Chapter 40.

### Memory Requirements Analysis

| Information Type | Memory Type | Rationale |
|------------------|-------------|-----------|
| Current task list | Conversation | Immediate context |
| Active task being modified | Working | Task in progress |
| "Last week you completed 15 tasks" | Episodic | Past events with timing |
| "Alex prefers morning tasks" | Semantic | Stable user fact |
| "Phoenix project deadline is Jan 31" | Semantic | Project fact |
| "Task estimates typically 50% low" | Semantic | Learned pattern |

### Example Memory Content

**Core Memory (Human Block):**
```
User: Alex Chen
Role: Senior Platform Engineer
Preferences:
- Prefers tasks created in morning (9-11am)
- Uses priority labels: critical, high, normal, low
- Likes estimated_hours on complex tasks
- Typical task completion: 2-4 per day
Working on: Phoenix Project (auth migration, deadline Jan 31)
```

**Semantic Memory:**
```json
{
  "projects": {
    "Phoenix": {
      "type": "migration",
      "deadline": "2025-01-31",
      "components": ["auth-service", "user-service"],
      "status": "active"
    }
  },
  "patterns": {
    "estimation_accuracy": 0.65,
    "typical_tasks_per_day": 3.2,
    "peak_productivity": "morning"
  }
}
```

**Episodic Memory (recent):**
```json
[
  {
    "date": "2025-01-20",
    "event": "Completed OAuth token refresh implementation",
    "duration_actual": "4 hours",
    "duration_estimated": "2 hours",
    "note": "Took longer due to edge cases"
  }
]
```

## Try With AI

Use these prompts to practice memory architecture design with Claude or your preferred AI assistant.

### Prompt 1: Memory Type Mapping

```
I'm building a coding assistant agent that helps developers with:
- Code review suggestions
- Bug diagnosis
- Documentation writing
- API design guidance

For each of these five memory types, give me concrete examples of what the agent should store:
1. Conversation memory
2. Working memory
3. Episodic memory
4. Semantic memory

Also: What information should be in "core memory" (always visible) vs "external memory" (retrieved on-demand)?
```

**What you're learning:** How to apply the five memory types to a specific domain. A coding assistant has very different memory needs than a task manager—code patterns, repository structure, and past debugging sessions become critical.

### Prompt 2: Episodic Memory for PR Reviews

```
An agent reviews pull requests for a development team. Design its episodic memory system.

Questions to answer:
1. What events should trigger episodic memory creation?
2. What metadata should each episode include?
3. How would the agent use episodic memory when reviewing a new PR from the same author?
4. How would it use episodic memory when reviewing a PR that touches the same files as a previous PR?

Give me a JSON schema for an episodic memory entry and 3 example entries.
```

**What you're learning:** Episodic memory isn't just "what happened"—it's about capturing context that enables better future decisions. For PR reviews, past patterns predict future needs.

### Prompt 3: Semantic Memory as Knowledge Graph

```
Design a knowledge graph structure for an agent that manages a software project.

The agent needs to understand:
- Team members and their roles
- Services and their dependencies
- Current sprints and deadlines
- Technical decisions and their rationale

Create:
1. Entity types (nodes)
2. Relationship types (edges)
3. Example queries the agent would run
4. How the agent would update this graph as the project evolves

Show a visual representation (ASCII or description) of a sample project's knowledge graph.
```

**What you're learning:** Semantic memory shines when relationships matter. A knowledge graph lets the agent answer "Who owns the service that depends on auth-service?" without searching through conversation logs.
