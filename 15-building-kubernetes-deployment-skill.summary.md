### Core Concept
Transform capstone knowledge into reusable cross-project guidance: extract decision frameworks (Persona + Questions + Principles) from single deployment into a skill that guides future deployments of different applications.

### Key Mental Models
- **Pattern Recognition**: Same decisions recur across projects (resource balance, probes, labels)—worth documenting if they pass frequency/complexity/value tests
- **Reasoning Activation**: Skill uses questions to force context-specific analysis, not retrieve memorized answers—guides thinking, not prescribes solutions
- **Intelligence Accumulation**: Skill compounds—used on second application, refined with learnings, becomes organizational reference

### Critical Patterns
- Define persona that activates analytical thinking (DevOps balancing speed/cost/reliability), not generic expertise claims
- Create decision points covering resource management, health checking, configuration, labeling, deployment strategy, disaster recovery
- Write principles explaining frameworks (how requests drive scheduling, why limits prevent waste) rather than rules (always set limits)
- Test skill on different application type—reveals what guidance transfers and what's too specific

### Common Mistakes
- Creating prescriptive rules instead of frameworks (too rigid for different contexts)
- Making persona too generic (doesn't activate specific thinking mode)
- Documenting only the capstone application's specifics instead of extracting reusable patterns
- Not testing skill on different application—skip validation that it actually guides cross-project thinking

### Connections
- **Builds on**: Capstone deployment (Lesson 10) and all foundation knowledge (Lessons 1-10)
- **Leads to**: Organizational intelligence, team-wide consistency, continuous improvement (skill refined with each new project)
