# Building the GitOps Deployment Skill

You've spent 17 lessons mastering CI/CD pipelines and GitOps principles. You understand sync strategies, ApplicationSets, secrets management, progressive delivery, and multi-cluster deployments. Now comes the most valuable lesson: **transforming tacit knowledge into reusable organizational intelligence**.

A skill is not a tutorial or a how-to guide. A skill captures **the reasoning patterns and decision frameworks** that enable someone to make good choices in a domain. By the end of this lesson, you'll have created a reusable skill that future teams can reference when designing deployments—not to follow steps blindly, but to activate their own reasoning.

## From Experience to Reusable Intelligence

Every time you deployed an application in this chapter, you made decisions:

- **Should this deployment use manual or automatic sync?** (Manual in production, auto in development)
- **How should secrets be injected?** (Never directly in Git; use External Secrets or Sealed Secrets)
- **What health checks must pass before traffic reaches the pod?** (Readiness probes determine success)
- **When does a deployment need sync waves?** (When initialization order matters)
- **How many environments do we need?** (Dev, staging, production with different policies)

These decisions weren't arbitrary. They reflected **principles** (why you decided this way) and **questions** (what context guided the decision).

A skill externalizes these reasoning patterns so they can be reused. When someone else needs to design a GitOps deployment—whether on their first project or their tenth—they can reference your skill and activate the same reasoning process you've developed through 17 lessons of practice.

## The Skill Design Framework: Persona + Questions + Principles

Reusable skills follow a three-part structure:

### Part 1: Persona (Adopt a Reasoning Stance)

A persona establishes **how you think about the domain**. It's not "who you are" but "what cognitive mode you operate in."

For GitOps, the persona might be: "Think like a DevOps architect who prioritizes automation, auditability, and operational reliability. You design deployments that are reproducible across environments, observable through logs and metrics, and recoverable when failures occur."

This persona activates the right mental model. It shifts thinking from "how do I deploy this?" (tactical) to "how do I design a system that deploys reliably over months?" (strategic).

### Part 2: Contextual Questions (Gather Decision-Relevant Context)

Before recommending a deployment strategy, you need context. Contextual questions are **not yes/no questions**; they're questions that reveal the constraints, requirements, and environment where decisions will be made.

For GitOps, contextual questions might ask:

- **Deployment context**: How many environments? Single or multi-cluster? What are the failure consequences?
- **Team capability**: Who deploys? What's their GitOps experience? How much manual approval can we require?
- **Architecture constraints**: Monorepo or multi-repo? Kustomize, Helm, or plain YAML? What secrets infrastructure exists?
- **Risk tolerance**: Is this a greenfield project or migrating existing deployments? Can we test progressive rollouts?

These questions serve two purposes: They ensure the skill's recommendations match the actual environment, and they force the person using the skill to think deeply about their deployment context.

### Part 3: Decision Principles (Provide Reasoning Frameworks)

Principles are the **why behind decisions**. They're not rules ("always use Sealed Secrets") but frameworks ("secrets should never appear in version control because Git history is immutable and impossible to redact").

A principle typically has:

1. **A clear statement** of what to optimize for
2. **The reasoning** explaining why this principle matters
3. **Guidance** on when and how to apply it

For example:

**Principle: Declarative > Imperative**
"Always define desired state in Git. Never rely on imperative kubectl commands for production deployments. If you deployed via kubectl edit directly on the cluster, you've violated this principle—the cluster state no longer matches Git state, making rollback impossible."

This principle:
- States the optimization: Declarative (system defined in files) over imperative (manual commands)
- Explains why: Enables rollback by reverting commits, enables audit trails, ensures reproducibility
- Provides guidance: If you catch yourself typing kubectl apply directly, something is wrong with your process

## Building Your GitOps Skill: Step by Step

### Step 1: Define Your Persona

Think about how you've approached GitOps throughout this chapter. What values have guided your decisions?

Draft a persona in 2-3 sentences that describes your thinking approach:

**Your Persona (draft this):**

"I think like a [role type] who values [optimization 1], [optimization 2], and [optimization 3]. I design [what type of system] that [key attribute], [key attribute]."

Example:
"I think like a DevOps architect who values automation, auditability, and reliability. I design deployment pipelines that are reproducible, observable through logs, and recoverable when failures occur."

### Step 2: Identify Contextual Questions

For each domain of GitOps decisions, list 2-4 questions that reveal important context:

**Deployment Architecture**
- How many environments will this application run in?
- Single cluster or multi-cluster?
- What are the failure consequences per environment?

**GitOps Implementation**
- Mono-repo or multi-repo for manifests?
- Will you use Helm, Kustomize, or plain YAML?
- What sync strategy makes sense per environment?

**Team & Organization**
- Who is responsible for deployments?
- What GitOps experience does the team have?
- How much manual approval can you require?

**Security & Compliance**
- What secrets infrastructure exists?
- Are there compliance requirements (audit trails, approval workflows)?
- What notification requirements exist for production changes?

### Step 3: Extract Decision Principles

For each major decision type you made in this chapter, articulate the principle underlying it.

**Example Principle 1: Sync Strategy Selection**

"Choose sync strategy based on risk tolerance. Development environments can auto-sync every change immediately—fast iteration matters. Staging environments can auto-sync but manual prune (prevents accidental deletion). Production requires manual sync or sync windows—human approval prevents mistakes from cascading."

**Example Principle 2: Secrets Never in Git**

"Plaintext secrets in Git repositories are a security incident waiting to happen. Git history is immutable; if a secret is committed, it cannot be redacted from older commits. Always use External Secrets Operator, Sealed Secrets, or Vault integration to inject secrets at runtime, never at commit time."

**Example Principle 3: Health Before Traffic**

"A deployment is not complete until the application reports healthy. Use readiness probes to determine when a pod is ready to receive traffic. Use liveness probes to restart unhealthy pods. ArgoCD health assessment must indicate 'Healthy' before the sync is considered complete."

# GitOps Deployment Skill

## Persona

Think like a DevOps architect who prioritizes automation, auditability, and operational reliability. You design deployment pipelines that:
- Are reproducible across environments and clusters
- Provide complete audit trails through Git history
- Recover quickly when failures occur
- Scale from single to multi-cluster deployments

## Contextual Questions

Before designing a GitOps deployment, gather context by answering these questions:

### Deployment Environment

1. How many environments will this application run in? (Dev, staging, production, others?)
2. Is this single-cluster or multi-cluster deployment?
3. What are the consequences of deployment failure in each environment?
4. What's the acceptable downtime for each environment?

### GitOps Architecture

1. Will you use mono-repo or multi-repo for ArgoCD manifests?
2. What templating approach? (Helm, Kustomize, plain YAML, or combination?)
3. What sync strategy per environment? (Auto-sync for dev, manual for prod?)
4. How will secrets be injected? (External Secrets, Sealed Secrets, Vault, or other?)

### Team & Organization

1. Who owns deployments—DevOps, platform team, feature teams?
2. What GitOps experience exists on the team?
3. How much manual approval can your deployment process require?
4. What notifications must occur on deployment events?

### Production Readiness

1. What progressive delivery strategy? (Canary, blue-green, standard rollout?)
2. What health checks must pass before a deployment is considered successful?
3. How long should deployment history be retained for rollback?
4. What observability is required? (Logs, metrics, traces, alerts?)

## Decision Principles

### P1: Declarative > Imperative

**Statement:** Always define desired state in Git. Never rely on imperative kubectl commands for production deployments.

**Why this matters:** Git becomes your source of truth. Every deployment state is versioned, auditable, and reproducible. If you manually kubectl edit a resource, the cluster diverges from Git, making rollback impossible.

**How to apply:** All production workloads must be defined in Git. No manual cluster modifications. If you catch yourself typing `kubectl apply` directly on production, stop—save the changes to a Git branch, create a pull request, and merge through Git.

### P2: Progressive Complexity

**Statement:** Start with manual sync and basic Applications. Add auto-sync, prune, self-heal, ApplicationSets, and hooks only when complexity justifies it.

**Why this matters:** Every feature you enable adds operational complexity. Auto-sync is powerful but can cascade failures across environments. Self-heal hides problems that should be investigated. Add features only when you're solving real problems.

**How to apply:** Begin with:
1. Manual sync (humans approve each deployment)
2. Basic Application CRD (source → destination, no fancy policies)

Then add in order as complexity demands:
1. Auto-sync (when manual approval becomes bottleneck)
2. Auto-prune (when orphaned resources become problem)
3. Self-heal (when drift detection matters more than investigating root causes)
4. ApplicationSets (when managing 10+ similar deployments)
5. Sync waves & hooks (when initialization order becomes critical)

### P3: Git Audit Trail

**Statement:** Every deployment must be traceable to a Git commit. Rollback means git revert, not kubectl delete.

**Why this matters:** Audit trails are required for compliance, debugging, and safety. When a production incident occurs, you need to know exactly what changed, when, and who approved it. This only works if all changes flow through Git.

**How to apply:** Establish clear workflow:
- Feature development → Pull request → Code review → Merge to main
- Merge to main triggers CI pipeline
- CI pipeline tests and builds container
- Merge to manifest repo triggers ArgoCD sync
- ArgoCD deploys the exact commit that was reviewed

If you need to patch production directly, this workflow is broken. Fix the process, not the symptom.

### P4: Sync Strategy by Risk

**Statement:** Choose sync strategy based on deployment risk. Low-risk environments can auto-sync; high-risk environments require manual sync or sync windows.

**Why this matters:** Auto-sync is convenient but propagates errors across environments. A bad deployment that breaks dev won't hurt anyone. A bad deployment that breaks production hurts users and business. Adjust automation to match risk.

**How to apply:**
- **Development**: Auto-sync, auto-prune, self-heal enabled. Speed matters; safety is secondary.
- **Staging**: Auto-sync, manual prune, self-heal disabled. Catch problems before production.
- **Production**: Manual sync only, or sync windows (e.g., 2pm UTC on Tuesdays). Require explicit human approval.

Create separate ArgoCD Applications for each environment with different sync policies. Same manifests, different policies.

### P5: Secrets Never in Git

**Statement:** Secrets must never appear in version control. Use External Secrets Operator, Sealed Secrets, or Vault integration to inject secrets at runtime.

**Why this matters:** Git history is immutable. Once a secret is committed, it exists in every clone of the repository, in every developer's local git history, and in CI logs. You cannot redact it. Assume any secret committed to Git is compromised.

**How to apply:**
1. Never commit plaintext secrets
2. Use External Secrets Operator to fetch from external vaults at runtime
3. Or use Sealed Secrets to encrypt secrets with cluster-specific keys
4. Or integrate with HashiCorp Vault
5. Always validate: `grep -r "password\|token\|key" manifests/ | grep -v "valueFrom" | grep -v "secretRef"`

If you find a secret in Git, rotate it immediately. Assume it's compromised.

### P6: Health Before Traffic

**Statement:** A deployment is not complete until the application reports healthy. Use readiness probes to determine when pods are ready for traffic. Health must be validated before a deployment succeeds.

**Why this matters:** Declaring a deployment "done" doesn't mean traffic will succeed. The pod might be in a crash loop. The application might not have initialized its database connection. ArgoCD considers a deployment healthy only when all pods and resources pass health checks.

**How to apply:**
1. Define readiness probes for every container (wait for startup)
2. Define liveness probes (restart if unhealthy)
3. In ArgoCD Applications, monitor health status
4. Only advance to next wave when previous wave reports Healthy
5. Set up alerts if deployment stalls in "Progressing" state

If a deployment shows "Healthy" but traffic fails, your health checks are insufficient. Tighten them.

## Applying This Skill

To use this skill when designing a new GitOps deployment:

1. **Adopt the Persona**: Think like a DevOps architect designing for reproducibility, auditability, and reliability.
2. **Answer the Questions**: Write down answers to each contextual question for your specific deployment.
3. **Apply the Principles**: Review each principle and explicitly decide how it applies to your situation.
4. **Document Your Decisions**: Record why you chose manual vs auto-sync, which secrets approach, which health checks. This reasoning becomes institutional knowledge.

## Validation Criteria

A deployment designed with this skill should satisfy these checks:

- [ ] All manifests are version-controlled in Git
- [ ] Sync strategy matches environment risk level
- [ ] No plaintext secrets appear in any manifest
- [ ] Every application has readiness and liveness probes
- [ ] Health checks defined for all resources
- [ ] Rollback capability verified (tested git revert)
- [ ] Audit trail complete (all changes traced to commits)
- [ ] Notifications configured for deployment events
- [ ] Secrets infrastructure validated (External Secrets or Sealed Secrets working)

If any validation fails, the deployment is incomplete. Don't proceed to production until all checks pass.
```

## Applying Your Skill in Practice

Now that you've created the skill, let's validate it works by applying it to a real scenario:

**Scenario**: Your team is designing a GitOps deployment for a critical payment-processing service. Here's how you'd use the skill:

### Using the Persona

You adopt the DevOps architect mindset: "What makes this deployment reproducible, auditable, and recoverable?"

This immediately shifts thinking from "how do we deploy the payment service?" to "how do we design a deployment system that protects against cascading failures, enables rollback, and provides complete audit trails?"

### Using the Questions

You work through the contextual questions:

- **Deployment context**: Payment service runs in dev, staging, production (3 environments). Prod failure directly costs company revenue.
- **Architecture**: Mono-repo (centralized control), Helm (versioned releases), External Secrets (AWS Secrets Manager integration existing).
- **Team**: DevOps team owns deployments, feature teams submit PRs. Approval required for production.
- **Production readiness**: Canary rollout (10% traffic first), liveness probe (health endpoint), readiness probe (database connection initialized), 7-day history.

### Using the Principles

For each principle, you make explicit decisions:

- **P1 (Declarative)**: All manifests in Git. No direct cluster modifications ever. Even emergency patches go through Git.
- **P2 (Progressive)**: Start with manual sync. Add auto-sync only if approval becomes bottleneck (low). No self-heal initially—investigate every drift.
- **P3 (Audit Trail)**: Every deployment must be a Git commit. Include PR number and approval in commit message.
- **P4 (Sync Strategy)**: Dev auto-syncs every push. Staging auto-syncs but requires manual validation. Prod requires explicit sync approval via CLI or UI.
- **P5 (Secrets)**: External Secrets Operator pulls credentials from AWS at runtime. Zero plaintext in manifests.
- **P6 (Health)**: Payment service has readiness (API endpoint responds), liveness (background job running), and customized ArgoCD health checks (all pods healthy AND successful canary traffic).

## Success: A Reusable Skill

By completing this lesson, you've created something more valuable than 17 individual lessons: a **reasoning framework** others can apply to their deployments.

The skill works because it activates reasoning, not memorization. It doesn't say "follow these 10 steps." It says "adopt this mindset, answer these questions about your context, and apply these principles to decide what's right for YOUR situation."

When a colleague asks "Should we use auto-sync for our staging environment?", you don't give them a step-by-step tutorial. You give them the skill. They adopt the DevOps architect persona, ask the context questions, review P4 (Sync Strategy by Risk), and make the right decision for their situation.

That's the difference between teaching and building organizational intelligence.

## Try With AI

**Setup**: You have a hypothetical deployment scenario. Use Claude to help refine your skill and test it against a real-world situation.

**Part 1: Validate Your Persona**

Ask Claude:
"I've drafted this persona for a GitOps Deployment Skill: [paste your persona from Step 1]. Does this persona activate the right thinking for making deployment decisions? What would you add or refine?"

**Part 2: Test Your Questions**

Provide Claude with this scenario:
"My team is deploying a machine learning batch job that runs daily. It's compute-intensive (10+ hour job), stores results in S3, and needs to retry on failure. How would my contextual questions help me design the right GitOps approach?"

Ask Claude to work through your questions and identify any gaps: "Looking at my contextual questions, what additional context would be important for designing GitOps for a batch job?"

**Part 3: Validate Your Principles**

Present one of your principles to Claude:
"Here's my P4 principle on Sync Strategy by Risk: [paste your principle]. Apply this principle to three different scenarios: (1) a non-critical internal tool, (2) a customer-facing API, (3) a database migration. Show me how the principle would guide different decisions in each case."

Review Claude's response. Does your principle actually guide good decisions? Do you need to refine it?

**Part 4: Integration Check**

Ask Claude: "Someone is designing a GitOps deployment for their first time. They read my skill. Can they make reasonable deployment decisions? What assumptions might they make that could fail? What should I clarify?"

**Expected outcome**: Your skill is clear enough that someone unfamiliar with your thinking can still make sound decisions by following the Persona + Questions + Principles structure.
