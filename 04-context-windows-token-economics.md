# Context Windows & Token Economics

You've been working with AI coding assistants for several chapters now. Sometimes responses feel sharp and specific. Other times, responses feel generic or repetitive. Sometimes the AI seems to forget what you discussed earlier in the same session.

These patterns aren't random. They're symptoms of context engineering---or the lack of it.

In this lesson, you'll learn to recognize what "context" means in AI development, estimate how much context you're using, and identify when you're approaching limits. You'll practice tracking context manually through session notes, building the foundation for more advanced context management techniques.

## Understanding Context Windows

When you start a conversation with an AI assistant, imagine opening a notebook with a fixed number of pages (ranging from 8,000 to 200,000+ depending on the model). Everything you type and every AI response gets written in this notebook, page by page. When the notebook fills up, older pages start getting compressed or forgotten to make room for new ones.

That notebook is your **context window**---the AI's working memory for your session.

### Context is Working Memory, Not Long-Term Storage

A context window is NOT:
- Permanent memory (it resets when you start a new session)
- Unlimited capacity (models range from 8K to 2M tokens depending on provider)
- Shared across sessions (Session A and Session B have separate context)

A context window IS:
- Working memory for the current conversation
- A fixed capacity that fills up as you work
- Shared between everything you load (files, messages, responses)

### Real Context Window Sizes

Different AI tools have different context capacities:

| Model | Context Window | Notes |
|-------|----------------|-------|
| **GPT-4o** | 128K tokens | OpenAI's flagship model |
| **Claude Sonnet/Opus** | 200K tokens | Extended to 1M available |
| **Gemini 2.5 Pro** | 2M tokens | Largest context available |

**What this means for you**: Most modern AI coding assistants work with 128K-200K tokens of context. That sounds like a lot, but it fills faster than you expect. Extended context windows (1M-2M tokens) are available from some providers, often at premium pricing.

**Long-context pricing**: Extended context windows typically cost more per token. Plan your token usage accordingly.

### Estimating Context: The Token-to-Word Rule

Since you can't see token counts directly, use this rule of thumb:

**1 word is approximately 1-1.2 tokens**

For quick estimates:
- **Simple text**: Multiply word count by **1.0**
- **Technical content with symbols**: Multiply word count by **1.2**

Example:
```
"Fix authentication bug in user login" = 6 words, approximately 7 tokens
```

## Session Notes: Your Context Tracking Tool

Before you can manage context efficiently, you need to track it. The simplest tool is a **session note**---a Markdown file documenting what you loaded, what you discussed, and how much context you've used.

### Session Note Template

Here's a basic template you'll use for tracking context:

```markdown
# Development Session - [DATE]

## Task: [What you're working on]

## Context Loaded:
- [File 1] - Est. [X] tokens
- [File 2] - Est. [Y] tokens
- Total loaded: ~[Z] tokens

## Progress:
1. [Action taken]
2. [AI response summary]
3. [Your observation]

## Token Estimation:
- Context loaded: ~[X] tokens
- Conversation so far: ~[Y] tokens (count words, multiply by 1.2)
- Total utilization: [X + Y] / 200,000 = [%]

## Observations:
- When did responses change tone or quality?
- When did AI forget earlier context?
- At what utilization % did patterns shift?
```

### Example Session Note

Here's what a real session note might look like:

```markdown
# Development Session - 2025-11-18

## Task: Write user guide for Chapter 11 markdown syntax

## Context Loaded:
- Chapter 11 outline (chapter-11-outline.md) - Est. 800 tokens
- Markdown syntax reference - Est. 1,200 tokens
- Previous chapter examples - Est. 2,000 tokens
- Total loaded: ~4,000 tokens

## Progress:
1. Asked Claude to suggest structure for user guide
2. Claude recommended 5 sections: Introduction, Basic Syntax, Advanced Features, Examples, Common Mistakes
3. I clarified that "Common Mistakes" section isn't needed (minimal content principle)
4. Claude adapted structure to 4 sections, focusing on examples over warnings
5. Drafted Introduction section collaboratively
6. Drafted Basic Syntax section

## Token Estimation:
- Context loaded: ~4,000 tokens
- Conversation (6 exchanges, ~1,500 words): ~1,800 tokens
- Total utilization: 5,800 / 200,000 = 2.9%

## Observations:
- Responses felt specific and well-tailored (low utilization, plenty of room)
- No forgotten context detected
- AI adapted suggestions based on feedback
```

**Observation**: At 2.9% utilization, this session has plenty of room. Responses are specific, AI remembers earlier constraints, and there's no evidence of context degradation.

## Warning Thresholds: Green, Yellow, Red

As your session progresses, context utilization increases. Use these thresholds to guide your actions:

### Green Zone (0-70% utilization)
- **Status**: Safe working range
- **Behavior**: Responses are specific, AI remembers context well
- **Action**: Continue working normally

### Yellow Zone (70-85% utilization)
- **Status**: Approaching limits
- **Behavior**: Responses may become slightly generic or slower
- **Action**: Plan to create a checkpoint soon

### Red Zone (85-100% utilization)
- **Status**: Context degradation likely
- **Behavior**: AI forgets patterns, repeats suggestions, responses become vague
- **Action**: Create checkpoint NOW and restart session

**Why these thresholds?** Empirical observation shows that degradation symptoms typically appear around 70-80% utilization, becoming severe above 85%.

## Built-In Context Tracking

Some modern AI models include **context awareness**—the model natively tracks its remaining token budget throughout a conversation and can plan accordingly.

### How It Works

AI coding assistants with context awareness receive updates on remaining capacity:

```
Token usage: 35000/200000; 165000 remaining
```

This means the AI knows exactly how much space it has left.

### What This Means for You

| Before Context Awareness | With Context Awareness |
|-------------------------|------------------------|
| Manual token estimation | AI tracks automatically |
| Guessing utilization % | AI knows precisely |
| Surprise context limits | AI can warn you |
| Abrupt session endings | AI can wrap up gracefully |

**The catch**: Context awareness helps AI manage itself, but understanding token economics is still valuable. When you understand *why* context fills up and *how* to track it manually, you can:
- Design better loading strategies
- Create more effective checkpoints
- Debug unexpected behavior
- Work with models that lack this feature

**Think of it like GPS vs. map reading**: GPS is incredibly useful, but understanding navigation fundamentals makes you a better driver. Context awareness automates tracking, but manual skills ensure you're never lost.

### Enabling Context-Aware Workflows

If you're using an AI coding assistant that compacts context, you can leverage this awareness:

```
Your context window will be automatically compacted as it approaches
its limit, allowing you to continue working indefinitely. Therefore,
do not stop tasks early due to token budget concerns. As you approach
your token budget limit, save your current progress and state to
memory before the context window refreshes.
```

This prompt tells the AI to be persistent and autonomous, trusting that compaction will handle context limits.

## Observable Behaviors: When Context Fills Up

Since you can't measure token counts precisely without programming tools, you'll rely on **observable behaviors** to recognize when context is filling up.

### Early Warning Signs (Yellow Zone)

Watch for these patterns:
- AI responses take longer to generate
- Responses become shorter than earlier in the session
- AI starts asking for clarification on things you stated earlier
- Suggestions feel less specific to your project

### Critical Symptoms (Red Zone)

These symptoms indicate severe context degradation:
- AI repeats the same suggestion multiple times
- AI forgets project patterns stated earlier in the session
- Responses are generic ("Use best practices") instead of specific
- AI asks you to re-explain information already provided

## Practice: Manual Context Tracking

Now it's time to build the habit of tracking context manually. These exercises help you develop awareness of context usage before using AI to manage it.

### Exercise 1: Write a Session Note

**Task**: Write a session note for a hypothetical development task.

**Scenario**: You're working with an AI coding assistant to write a project README. You've loaded:
- Project specification (2,500 words)
- Existing documentation examples (1,800 words)
- Chapter structure outline (600 words)

You've had 8 exchanges with the AI (approximately 2,000 words total).

**Your Task**:
1. Create a session note using the template above
2. Estimate tokens for each piece of context (use word count times 1.2)
3. Calculate total utilization percentage
4. Identify which warning zone you're in (green, yellow, or red)

### Exercise 2: Compare Two Projects

**Project A**: Small markdown documentation
- 3 files loaded (total 5,000 words)
- 10 exchanges with AI (2,500 words)

**Project B**: Complex specification project
- 12 files loaded (total 18,000 words)
- 15 exchanges with AI (4,000 words)

**Your Task**:
1. Calculate utilization for both projects
2. Which project is closer to yellow zone?
3. Which project should create a checkpoint sooner?
4. Explain your reasoning

### Exercise 3: Identify Warning Signals

Read this conversation excerpt:

```
YOU: "Based on our earlier discussion about using camelCase for variables, how should I name this function?"

AI: "There are many naming conventions. You could use camelCase, snake_case, or PascalCase depending on your project's style guide."

YOU: "But we agreed on camelCase 10 minutes ago."

AI: "You're right, I apologize for the confusion. Let's use camelCase consistently."
```

**Your Task**:
1. Which context degradation symptom is present?
2. If you see this behavior, what utilization range are you likely in?
3. What action should you take?

## Try With AI

Now that you understand context windows and manual estimation, practice validating your estimates with your AI assistant.

### Setup
Open your AI coding assistant (Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, etc.) and keep your session notes nearby for reference.

### Prompt 1: Verify Token Estimate

```
I estimated this session note uses approximately [X] tokens. Here's my breakdown:
- [List your calculations]

Looking at the word count and content complexity, is my estimate reasonable? What factors might I have missed?
```

**What you're learning**: Calibrating your mental model for token estimation---learning where your estimates need adjustment.

### Prompt 2: Estimate Utilization for Your Current Session

```
I've loaded these files: [list files with word counts]
We've had [N] exchanges with approximately [M] words total.

Help me estimate: What's my current context utilization percentage?
```

**What you're learning**: Real-time context awareness---understanding how to monitor utilization during active work.

### Prompt 3: Identify Warning Zone

```
Based on this utilization estimate: [your calculation]

Which warning zone am I in (green/yellow/red)? What behaviors should I watch for at this utilization level?
```

**What you're learning**: Translating numbers into action---connecting abstract percentages to concrete behaviors you should watch for.

### Expected Outcomes

Your AI assistant should:
- Validate your token estimates (within ~20% accuracy)
- Explain factors you might have missed (formatting overhead, special characters)
- Confirm warning zone thresholds
- Recommend checkpoint timing based on remaining work

**Safety Note**: Trust your manual observations over AI estimates. If responses feel generic or repetitive, you're likely in yellow/red zone regardless of calculated utilization. Your experience of response quality is ultimately more reliable than any calculation.
