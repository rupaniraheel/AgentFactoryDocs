# Cloud Cost Fundamentals

Your Task API runs perfectly in development. The container starts in seconds, the database responds instantly, and everything feels free. Then deployment day arrives. You push to production, users start flowing in, and the invoices start arriving.

The first bill shocks you: $847 for a single month. You expected maybe $50. You dig into the breakdown: compute resources you requested but barely used, storage volumes sitting idle, network egress you never considered. The costs feel invisible until they become painfully visible.

This is the reality of cloud-native development. Kubernetes abstracts infrastructure beautifully—you declare what you need, and it appears. But that abstraction hides a fundamental truth: **every resource has a price, and that price accumulates silently**. Understanding cloud costs isn't optional; it's the difference between a profitable Digital FTE and one that bleeds money.

This lesson teaches the conceptual foundation of cloud costs: the three pillars (compute, storage, network), how Kubernetes calculates costs, and the FinOps cycle that transforms cost chaos into cost intelligence.

## Why Cost Visibility Matters for Digital FTEs

Digital FTEs are products you sell. Like any product, they have a cost of goods sold (COGS). Unlike physical products, cloud costs are:

**Variable**: Costs scale with usage. A quiet Tuesday costs less than a traffic spike on launch day.

**Invisible**: There's no factory floor to walk. Resources consume dollars silently in the background.

**Attributed**: Modern cloud billing can trace costs to specific services, teams, and even features. But only if you instrument properly.

**The business impact**: Your Task API Digital FTE might charge customers $500/month. If it costs $400/month to run, your margin is 20%. If you can reduce costs to $200/month, your margin jumps to 60%. Cost optimization directly impacts profitability.

**The visibility problem**: Most teams have no idea what their services actually cost. They see a cluster-wide bill but can't answer: "How much does the inference service cost compared to the API gateway?" Without visibility, optimization is guesswork.

## The Three Pillars of Cloud Costs

Cloud costs break into three fundamental categories. Each behaves differently, dominates different workloads, and requires different optimization strategies.

### Pillar 1: Compute Costs

**What it is**: The price of CPU cycles and memory allocation. When your Task API processes a request, it consumes compute.

**How it's billed**: Per hour (or second) of allocated resources. You pay for what you request, even if you don't use it.

**What drives it**:
- Number of pod replicas
- CPU and memory requests per pod
- Node instance types (larger nodes cost more)
- Time pods are running

**Example**: Your Task API runs 3 replicas, each requesting 500m CPU and 512Mi memory. The nodes cost $0.10 per CPU-hour. Monthly compute cost:

```
3 replicas x 0.5 CPU x 730 hours x $0.10 = $109.50
```

**When compute dominates**:
- AI inference services (heavy CPU/GPU usage)
- Data processing pipelines
- Services with many replicas

**Optimization levers**:
- Right-size requests (don't over-provision)
- Scale to zero during off-hours
- Use spot/preemptible instances for fault-tolerant workloads

### Pillar 2: Storage Costs

**What it is**: The price of persistent data. Databases, logs, backups, and container images all consume storage.

**How it's billed**: Per GB-month of provisioned storage. You pay for what you allocate, not what you use.

**What drives it**:
- PersistentVolumeClaim sizes
- Database storage (often separate from Kubernetes)
- Container registry images
- Backup retention policies
- Log storage

**Example**: Your Task API uses a 100GB PostgreSQL volume and keeps 30 days of backups. At $0.10/GB-month:

```
Production: 100 GB x $0.10 = $10/month
Backups: 100 GB x 30 copies x $0.03 = $90/month (cheaper storage class)
Total: $100/month
```

**When storage dominates**:
- Data-intensive applications (analytics, ML training data)
- Long backup retention requirements
- Extensive logging systems

**Optimization levers**:
- Use tiered storage (hot/warm/cold)
- Implement retention policies (delete old data)
- Compress backups
- Right-size volumes (don't provision 1TB "just in case")

### Pillar 3: Network Costs

**What it is**: The price of data movement. When your Task API sends a response to a user, that's network egress.

**How it's billed**: Per GB of data transferred. Ingress (data in) is usually free. Egress (data out) costs money.

**What drives it**:
- API response sizes
- Cross-region communication
- External API calls
- Container image pulls
- Inter-service communication (within cluster is usually free)

**Example**: Your Task API returns 10KB average per response, handling 1 million requests per month:

```
Data out: 1,000,000 x 10KB = 10 GB
At $0.09/GB: 10 GB x $0.09 = $0.90/month
```

**When network dominates**:
- CDN/media streaming services
- Multi-region deployments
- Services with large response payloads
- Heavy external API integrations

**Optimization levers**:
- Compress responses
- Cache at the edge
- Keep communication within regions
- Batch external API calls

## Comparing the Three Pillars

| Pillar | What You Pay For | Typical Range | Optimization Focus |
|--------|------------------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Compute** | CPU + Memory hours | 50-70% of bill | Right-size, autoscale, spot instances |
| **Storage** | GB-months allocated | 15-30% of bill | Tiered storage, retention policies |
| **Network** | GB transferred out | 5-20% of bill | Compression, caching, regional locality |

**The dominance pattern**: For most Kubernetes workloads, compute dominates. But this varies dramatically:

- **Task API (typical service)**: 65% compute, 25% storage, 10% network
- **ML training pipeline**: 80% compute, 15% storage, 5% network
- **Video streaming service**: 30% compute, 20% storage, 50% network
- **Data warehouse**: 40% compute, 50% storage, 10% network

**Understanding your mix is the first step to optimization.**

## The Kubernetes Cost Formula

Kubernetes adds a layer of complexity: you request resources, but you might not use them all. The cost formula reflects this:

```
Cost = max(request, usage) x hourly_rate x hours
```

**Breaking this down**:

**Request**: What you asked for in your pod spec. This reserves capacity on the node.

**Usage**: What your container actually consumed. Measured by Prometheus or similar.

**max(request, usage)**: You pay for whichever is higher. Over-request and you waste money. Under-request and you might get throttled.

### Example: Task API Cost Calculation

Your Task API deployment:

```yaml
resources:
  requests:
    cpu: 500m      # 0.5 CPU
    memory: 512Mi  # 512 MB
  limits:
    cpu: 1000m
    memory: 1Gi
```

Actual usage (from Prometheus):
- CPU: 200m average
- Memory: 300Mi average

Cost calculation:

```
CPU: max(500m, 200m) = 500m (you pay for request, not usage)
Memory: max(512Mi, 300Mi) = 512Mi

Hourly CPU cost: 0.5 CPU x $0.10/CPU-hour = $0.05
Hourly memory cost: 0.5 GB x $0.02/GB-hour = $0.01
Total hourly: $0.06

Monthly (730 hours): $0.06 x 730 = $43.80 per replica
```

**The efficiency problem**: You requested 500m CPU but used 200m. Your efficiency is 40%. You're paying for 60% idle capacity.

**This is called idle cost**: resources you pay for but don't use.

## Idle Cost: The Hidden Waste

Idle cost represents the gap between what you reserve and what you use:

```
Idle Cost = (request - usage) x hourly_rate x hours
Efficiency = usage / request x 100%
```

**Industry benchmarks**:
- **Poor**: Less than 30% efficiency (common in development)
- **Average**: 30-50% efficiency (typical production)
- **Good**: 50-70% efficiency (well-optimized workloads)
- **Excellent**: 70%+ efficiency (highly optimized, with autoscaling)

**Why idle cost exists**:
- Developers over-request "just in case"
- Traffic patterns vary (night vs day)
- Batch jobs complete faster than expected
- Scaling doesn't match actual load

**How to reduce it**:
- Use Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) recommendations
- Implement Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) for traffic-based scaling
- Right-size based on actual usage data
- Scale down during off-peak hours

## The FinOps Cycle: From Chaos to Control

FinOps (Cloud Financial Operations) provides a structured approach to cost management. It's a cycle, not a one-time project:

### Phase 1: Visibility (See the Costs)

**Goal**: Know what you're spending and where.

**Activities**:
- Deploy cost monitoring (OpenCost, Kubecost)
- Tag resources for attribution (team, app, environment)
- Build dashboards showing cost by service
- Establish showback reports (share costs with teams)

**Key questions answered**:
- What's the total cluster cost?
- Which namespaces/services cost the most?
- How do costs trend over time?
- Where is idle cost accumulating?

**Tools**: OpenCost, Prometheus, Grafana dashboards

**Maturity signal**: Teams can answer "How much does my service cost?" within 24 hours.

### Phase 2: Optimization (Reduce the Costs)

**Goal**: Reduce waste without impacting performance.

**Activities**:
- Right-size based on VPA recommendations
- Implement autoscaling (HPA, KEDA)
- Use spot instances for appropriate workloads
- Optimize storage tiers and retention
- Delete unused resources

**Key questions answered**:
- Which resources are over-provisioned?
- What's our idle cost percentage?
- Which optimizations have the highest ROI?
- Are we using the right instance types?

**Tools**: VPA, HPA, Spot instance policies

**Maturity signal**: Teams have reduced idle cost below 50% and can quantify savings.

### Phase 3: Operation (Maintain Efficiency)

**Goal**: Sustain cost efficiency as systems evolve.

**Activities**:
- Set cost budgets and alerts
- Review costs in sprint retrospectives
- Chargeback to cost centers (optional)
- Governance policies (require cost labels, enforce limits)
- Continuous right-sizing as usage patterns change

**Key questions answered**:
- Are we staying within budget?
- How do new features impact cost?
- Are teams accountable for their costs?
- Do we have governance preventing waste?

**Tools**: Budget alerts, policy enforcement, regular reviews

**Maturity signal**: Cost is a standing item in operational reviews, and teams self-correct when budgets are exceeded.

## The FinOps Cycle in Action

The three phases form a continuous loop:

```
   ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
   │                                             │
   ▼                                             │
Visibility ──────► Optimization ──────► Operation
   │                    │                   │
   │ "What are we       │ "How do we       │ "How do we
   │  spending?"        │  spend less?"    │  stay efficient?"
   │                    │                   │
   └────────────────────┴───────────────────┘
                   (continuous cycle)
```

**Example cycle for Task API**:

1. **Visibility**: Deploy OpenCost. Discover Task API costs $847/month, with 65% idle cost.

2. **Optimization**: Apply VPA recommendations. Reduce CPU requests from 500m to 250m. Implement HPA to scale replicas based on traffic. New cost: $380/month.

3. **Operation**: Set budget alert at $450/month. Add cost review to monthly ops meeting. When the inference service is added, immediately track its cost impact.

4. **Back to Visibility**: Notice new inference service now costs more than Task API. Start optimization cycle for it.

## Building Your Mental Model

Before deploying cost tools in later lessons, internalize this framework:

**The three pillars** tell you WHERE money goes:
- Compute: CPU and memory for running containers
- Storage: Persistent data and backups
- Network: Data moving between services and users

**The cost formula** tells you HOW Kubernetes charges:
- You pay for max(request, usage)
- Over-requesting creates idle cost
- Efficiency = usage / request

**The FinOps cycle** tells you WHAT to do about it:
- Visibility: See the costs (can't optimize what you can't see)
- Optimization: Reduce waste (right-size, autoscale)
- Operation: Maintain efficiency (budgets, governance, reviews)

**The business connection**: Your Digital FTE's profitability depends on managing these costs. A $500/month product that costs $400 to run isn't sustainable. Understanding cost fundamentals is the first step to building profitable AI services.

## Try With AI

These prompts help you apply cost concepts to your own projects.

**Prompt 1: Cost Profile Analysis**

```
My Task API deployment has these resource requests:
- 3 replicas
- Each: 1 CPU, 2Gi memory
- PersistentVolume: 50Gi
- Average response size: 5KB
- 500,000 requests/month

Assuming:
- CPU: $0.10/CPU-hour
- Memory: $0.02/GB-hour
- Storage: $0.10/GB-month
- Network egress: $0.09/GB

Calculate my monthly costs broken down by pillar.
Which pillar dominates? What would you optimize first?
```

**What you're learning:** How to apply the cost formula and identify which pillar offers the biggest optimization opportunity.

**Prompt 2: FinOps Phase Identification**

```
I have these cost challenges in my Kubernetes cluster:
1. No idea which team is responsible for which costs
2. Pods requesting 4GB memory but using only 500MB
3. Monthly costs exceeded budget by 40% last month
4. Storage volumes from deleted apps still exist

For each challenge, identify:
- Which FinOps phase addresses it (Visibility, Optimization, or Operation)
- What specific action would solve it
- What tool or process to implement
```

**What you're learning:** How to map real cost problems to the FinOps framework and identify appropriate solutions.

**Prompt 3: Idle Cost Calculation**

```
My deployment has these actual metrics from Prometheus:
- CPU request: 500m, usage: 150m average
- Memory request: 1Gi, usage: 400Mi average
- Running 24/7 for 30 days
- CPU rate: $0.10/CPU-hour
- Memory rate: $0.02/GB-hour

Calculate:
1. Total cost (what I'm paying)
2. Actual usage cost (if I paid only for usage)
3. Idle cost (the waste)
4. Efficiency percentage
5. What should my requests be to achieve 70% efficiency?
```

**What you're learning:** How to quantify waste and right-size resources for target efficiency.

**Safety note:** Cost data can reveal business-sensitive information (revenue, margins, team budgets). In production, restrict access to cost dashboards and avoid sharing detailed cost breakdowns publicly.

## Reflect on Your Skill

You built an `operational-excellence` skill in Lesson 0. Test and improve it based on what you learned.

### Test Your Skill

```
Using my operational-excellence skill, explain the three pillars of cloud costs.
Does my skill describe compute, storage, and network costs correctly?
Does it explain the Kubernetes cost formula: max(request, usage) x rate?
```

### Identify Gaps

Ask yourself:
- Did my skill include the FinOps cycle (Visibility, Optimization, Operation)?
- Did it explain idle cost and how to calculate efficiency?
- Did it distinguish when each pillar dominates different workload types?

### Improve Your Skill

```
My operational-excellence skill is missing the FinOps cycle framework.
Update it to include:
1. The three phases: Visibility, Optimization, Operation
2. What each phase addresses
3. How they form a continuous improvement loop
Also add the cost formula: max(request, usage) x hourly_rate x hours
```
