# Dapr Security: mTLS, API Tokens, and Component Scopes

When you deploy Dapr sidecars alongside your Task API, traffic between sidecars is already encrypted with mTLS. This happens automatically—Dapr's Sentry service acts as a Certificate Authority, issuing short-lived certificates to each sidecar. But "automatically encrypted" is not the same as "production secure."

In January 2024, a fintech company discovered their Dapr deployment had a critical gap: while sidecar-to-sidecar traffic was encrypted, any application in the cluster could access any Dapr component. Their Redis statestore—containing session tokens—was accessible from a compromised logging pod in a different namespace. The fix was component scopes: a single YAML field that took 30 seconds to add but prevented a potential breach.

This lesson teaches you to verify the security Dapr provides automatically, then add the isolation controls it doesn't enable by default.

---

## Verify mTLS is Active

Before adding security controls, confirm Dapr's automatic protections are working. The Sentry service must be healthy and issuing certificates.

### Check Dapr System Health

```bash
dapr status -k
```

**Output:**

```
  NAME                   NAMESPACE    HEALTHY  STATUS   REPLICAS  VERSION  AGE  CREATED
  dapr-sidecar-injector  dapr-system  True     Running  1         1.12.0   7d   2024-01-15 10:23:45
  dapr-operator          dapr-system  True     Running  1         1.12.0   7d   2024-01-15 10:23:45
  dapr-sentry            dapr-system  True     Running  1         1.12.0   7d   2024-01-15 10:23:45
  dapr-placement-server  dapr-system  True     Running  1         1.12.0   7d   2024-01-15 10:23:45
```

**What to verify:**

| Component | Status | Meaning |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| dapr-sentry | Running | CA is healthy, can issue certificates |
| dapr-sidecar-injector | Running | Sidecars will be injected into pods |
| dapr-operator | Running | Component reconciliation works |

If `dapr-sentry` shows anything other than `Running`, mTLS certificates cannot be issued and sidecar communication fails.

### Verify Sentry Certificate

Check the root certificate that Sentry uses to sign sidecar certificates:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n dapr-system -l app=dapr-sentry -o name | head -1 | \
  xargs -I {} kubectl exec {} -n dapr-system -- \
  openssl x509 -in /var/run/secrets/dapr.io/tls/ca.crt -noout -dates
```

**Output:**

```
notBefore=Jan 15 10:23:45 2024 GMT
notAfter=Jan 15 10:23:45 2025 GMT
```

**What this tells you:**

- `notBefore`: When the CA certificate became valid
- `notAfter`: When the CA certificate expires (plan rotation before this date)

Sidecar certificates have a 24-hour TTL by default, but they depend on this root CA. If the root expires, all sidecars lose their trust anchor.

### Verify mTLS Between Sidecars

From inside a sidecar, verify certificates are being used:

```bash
kubectl exec -n task-api deploy/task-api -c daprd -- \
  ls /var/run/secrets/dapr.io/tls/
```

**Output:**

```
ca.crt
cert.pem
key.pem
```

The presence of these files confirms:
- `ca.crt`: Root CA for validating other sidecars
- `cert.pem`: This sidecar's identity certificate
- `key.pem`: Private key for this certificate

If these files are missing, mTLS is not configured—check your Dapr installation.

---

## Discovering mTLS Commands with AI

You've verified mTLS is working, but the commands you just ran aren't obvious. Let's see how AI collaboration helps you discover these verification techniques.

### Your Initial Request

You need to verify Dapr security but aren't sure what to check:

```
I deployed Dapr on Kubernetes. How do I verify that mTLS is actually
working between my sidecars?
```

### AI's Recommendation

AI suggests a verification approach you hadn't considered:

"Beyond checking dapr-sentry status, you should verify three levels:

1. **System level**: `dapr status -k` confirms Sentry is running
2. **Certificate level**: Examine the CA certificate expiry in Sentry pods
3. **Runtime level**: Check that sidecar pods have certificates mounted at `/var/run/secrets/dapr.io/tls/`

For ongoing monitoring, I'd also suggest enabling the Dapr metrics endpoint and tracking certificate renewal events. Here's a command to check certificate days until expiry:

```bash
kubectl exec -n dapr-system deploy/dapr-sentry -- \
  openssl x509 -in /var/run/secrets/dapr.io/tls/ca.crt -noout -enddate | \
  cut -d= -f2 | xargs -I {} date -d {} +%s | \
  xargs -I {} bash -c 'echo $(( ({} - $(date +%s)) / 86400 )) days until expiry'
```

This gives you a single number for monitoring dashboards."

### What Emerged

The AI suggested a monitoring approach—certificate expiry tracking—that you hadn't asked about but is critical for production. This is knowledge transfer: AI teaches you a pattern you didn't know existed.

## Configure Component Scopes

By default, any Dapr-enabled application can access any Dapr component. This violates least privilege—your Task API shouldn't be able to access another service's statestore.

### Understanding the Risk

Without scopes, your cluster has this access matrix:

| Application | statestore (redis) | pubsub (kafka) | secrets (vault) |
|-------------|-------------------|----------------|-----------------|
| task-api | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| auth-service | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| logging-pod | Yes | Yes | Yes |

Any compromised pod with a Dapr sidecar can access all components.

### Add Scopes to Your Statestore

Update your Redis statestore component to restrict access:

```yaml
apiVersion: dapr.io/v1alpha1
kind: Component
metadata:
  name: statestore
  namespace: production
spec:
  type: state.redis
  version: v1
  metadata:
  - name: redisHost
    value: redis:6379
  - name: redisPassword
    secretKeyRef:
      name: redis-secret
      key: password
  scopes:
  - task-api  # Only task-api can access this component
```

**Output (after applying):**

```bash
kubectl apply -f statestore-scoped.yaml
```

```
component.dapr.io/statestore configured
```

### Verify Scope Enforcement

Try to access the statestore from a different application:

```bash
# From a pod with app-id: test-app (not in scopes list)
curl http://localhost:3500/v1.0/state/statestore
```

**Output:**

```json
{
  "errorCode": "ERR_STATE_STORE_NOT_FOUND",
  "message": "state store statestore is not found"
}
```

The component exists, but it's invisible to applications not in the scopes list. This is security through explicit allowlisting—the same pattern as NetworkPolicy default-deny.

### Scoped Access Matrix

After adding scopes, your access matrix becomes:

| Application | statestore | pubsub | secrets |
|-------------|------------|--------|---------|
| task-api | **Yes** | No | No |
| auth-service | No | No | No |
| logging-pod | No | No | No |

Each component should have a minimal scopes list.

---

## Refining Requirements with AI Collaboration

Your initial component scope configuration assumed production requirements. But development and production have different needs. Let's iterate with AI to handle both environments.

### Your Environment Concern

After configuring scopes, you realize a gap:

```
My component scopes work for production, but in development I need
multiple services to access the statestore for testing. I don't want
to maintain two completely different component files.
```

### AI's Initial Suggestion

"You could use Helm values to template the scopes list:

```yaml
scopes:
{{- range .Values.statestore.allowedApps }}
- {{ . }}
{{- end }}
```

With `values-dev.yaml`:
```yaml
statestore:
  allowedApps:
    - task-api
    - test-runner
    - debug-tools
```

And `values-prod.yaml`:
```yaml
statestore:
  allowedApps:
    - task-api
```

This keeps one component template with environment-specific scope lists."

### Your Refinement

The Helm approach adds complexity you don't want yet. You push back:

```
I'm not using Helm for Dapr components yet. Can I solve this with
Kubernetes namespaces instead? Production and development are already
in different namespaces.
```

### AI's Adapted Approach

"Good constraint. Dapr components are namespace-scoped, so you can create separate component resources in each namespace:

**production/statestore.yaml:**
```yaml
apiVersion: dapr.io/v1alpha1
kind: Component
metadata:
  name: statestore
  namespace: production
spec:
  type: state.redis
  version: v1
  metadata:
  - name: redisHost
    value: redis.production:6379
  scopes:
  - task-api  # Strict: production only
```

**development/statestore.yaml:**
```yaml
apiVersion: dapr.io/v1alpha1
kind: Component
metadata:
  name: statestore
  namespace: development
spec:
  type: state.redis
  version: v1
  metadata:
  - name: redisHost
    value: redis.development:6379
  scopes:
  - task-api
  - test-runner
  - debug-tools  # Relaxed: development convenience
```

Each namespace has its own component with appropriate scopes. No templating, standard Kubernetes patterns."

### What Changed Through Iteration

Neither you nor AI started with the namespace-per-environment approach:
- You initially wanted one file for both environments
- AI suggested Helm templating based on common patterns
- You added the constraint (no Helm yet)
- Together you converged on namespace isolation—simpler and using tools already in place

This is collaborative refinement: the final solution emerged from iterating together.

## API Token Authentication (Optional)

mTLS encrypts traffic and verifies sidecar identity. API tokens add another layer: authenticating individual requests between the Dapr sidecar and your application.

### When to Enable API Tokens

| Scenario | mTLS Sufficient? | Add API Token? |
|----------|------------------|----------------|
| Sidecar-to-sidecar calls | Yes | Optional |
| App-to-sidecar (localhost) | Usually | Yes if shared pod network |
| Exposing Dapr API externally | **No** | **Required** |

For most Kubernetes deployments, mTLS between sidecars is sufficient. Add API tokens when:
- Multiple containers share a pod's network namespace
- You're exposing Dapr APIs outside the cluster
- Compliance requires request-level authentication

### Create API Token Secret

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: dapr-api-token
  namespace: production
type: Opaque
data:
  token: c3VwZXItc2VjcmV0LXRva2VuLTEyMw==  # base64 encoded
```

### Configure Sidecar to Require Token

Add annotation to your deployment:

```yaml
annotations:
  dapr.io/enabled: "true"
  dapr.io/app-id: "task-api"
  dapr.io/app-port: "8000"
  dapr.io/app-token-secret: "dapr-api-token"  # Require token from app
```

Your application now must include the token in requests to its sidecar:

```python
import httpx

headers = {"dapr-api-token": "super-secret-token-123"}
response = httpx.get(
    "http://localhost:3500/v1.0/state/statestore/mykey",
    headers=headers
)
```

### Verify Token Enforcement

Without the token:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3500/v1.0/state/statestore/mykey
```

**Output:**

```json
{
  "errorCode": "ERR_UNAUTHORIZED",
  "message": "invalid token"
}
```

With the token:

```bash
curl -H "dapr-api-token: super-secret-token-123" \
  http://localhost:3500/v1.0/state/statestore/mykey
```

**Output:**

```json
{"value": "my-stored-data"}
```

---

## Restrict Sidecar Listen Addresses

By default, the Dapr sidecar listens on all interfaces (`0.0.0.0`). In a shared pod network, this could allow other containers to call your sidecar. Restrict to localhost:

```yaml
annotations:
  dapr.io/enabled: "true"
  dapr.io/app-id: "task-api"
  dapr.io/sidecar-listen-addresses: "127.0.0.1"  # Localhost only
```

This ensures only the main application container can reach the sidecar—defense in depth alongside component scopes.

---

## Complete Task API Dapr Security Configuration

Here's the full security configuration for your Task API deployment:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: task-api
  namespace: production
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: task-api
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: task-api
      annotations:
        # Dapr sidecar configuration
        dapr.io/enabled: "true"
        dapr.io/app-id: "task-api"
        dapr.io/app-port: "8000"

        # Security hardening
        dapr.io/sidecar-listen-addresses: "127.0.0.1"
        dapr.io/enable-api-logging: "true"
    spec:
      serviceAccountName: task-api-sa
      containers:
      - name: task-api
        image: ghcr.io/org/task-api:v1.0.0
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8000
---
apiVersion: dapr.io/v1alpha1
kind: Component
metadata:
  name: statestore
  namespace: production
spec:
  type: state.redis
  version: v1
  metadata:
  - name: redisHost
    value: redis:6379
  - name: redisPassword
    secretKeyRef:
      name: redis-secret
      key: password
  scopes:
  - task-api  # Isolated to Task API only
```

**Security checklist applied:**

- [x] mTLS verified (Sentry healthy)
- [x] Component scopes restrict statestore to task-api only
- [x] Sidecar listens only on localhost
- [x] API logging enabled for audit trail
- [x] Secrets referenced via secretKeyRef (not plaintext)

---

## Reflect on Your Skill

Test your `cloud-security` skill against Dapr security patterns:

```
Using my cloud-security skill, configure Dapr security for a payment
processing service that:
- Must have mTLS verification documented
- Needs isolated access to a statestore and pubsub component
- Requires API tokens because it shares pod network with a sidecar proxy
```

**Evaluation questions:**

1. Does your skill include mTLS verification commands?
2. Does your skill configure component scopes correctly?
3. Does your skill know when to recommend API tokens vs rely on mTLS alone?
4. Does your skill differentiate development vs production requirements?

If any answers are "no," update your skill with the patterns from this lesson.

## Try With AI

Test your understanding of Dapr security configuration and troubleshooting.

**Prompt 1:**

```
My Dapr sidecars are running but I see "certificate expired" errors in
the logs. What verification commands should I run, and what's the fix?
```

**What you're learning:** Certificate lifecycle management. The solution involves checking Sentry CA expiry with `openssl x509 -enddate` and running `dapr mtls renew-certificate -k` if needed. Notice if AI explains the difference between sidecar certificates (24h TTL, auto-renewed) and the root CA (1 year, manual renewal).

**Prompt 2:**

```
I have three services: order-api, inventory-api, and notification-service.
Design Dapr component scopes so that:
- order-api can access statestore and pubsub
- inventory-api can access only statestore
- notification-service can access only pubsub
```

**What you're learning:** Least-privilege component design. Each component needs its own scopes array, not a single shared configuration. Notice if AI creates separate component definitions or tries to use a single component with multiple scopes.

**Prompt 3:**

```
When should I enable API tokens for Dapr in Kubernetes? My pods each
have a single container and I'm using standard Kubernetes networking.
```

**What you're learning:** Security threat modeling. For single-container pods with mTLS, API tokens add minimal value since localhost is already isolated. The scenario where tokens matter is multi-container pods or external Dapr API exposure. Notice if AI asks clarifying questions about your deployment model.

:::warning Security Reminder
Component scopes are your primary defense against lateral movement through Dapr. A compromised pod without Dapr components in its scope list cannot access state stores, pub/sub, or secrets through Dapr APIs—even if the attacker has full control of the pod. Always apply least-privilege scopes before deploying to production.
