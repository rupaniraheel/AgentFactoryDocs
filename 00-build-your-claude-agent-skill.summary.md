### Core Concept
Before learning Claude Agent SDK—the architecture behind Claude Code itself—you own a working skill built from official documentation. Skill-first learning means you graduate with an asset, not just knowledge.

### Key Mental Models
- **Skill-first learning**: Build the asset before studying theory
- **Documentation-grounded**: Context7 fetches official docs, not memory-based assumptions
- **Ownership**: You own a sellable skill, not just understanding

### Critical Patterns
- Clone `claude-code-skills-lab` fresh
- Prompt: "Using your skill creator skill create a new skill for Claude Agent SDK... Use context7 skill to study official documentation"
- Skill appears at `.claude/skills/claude-agent-sdk/`

### AI Collaboration Keys
- Let Claude ask clarifying questions (tool patterns, subagent needs, hook requirements)
- Trust Context7 for current API patterns

### Common Mistakes
- Building skill from memory instead of official documentation
- Skipping the skill creation step and jumping to lessons

### Connections
- **Builds on**: Skills-lab infrastructure from previous chapters
- **Leads to**: SDK Architecture (Lesson 1) where you understand what your skill knows
