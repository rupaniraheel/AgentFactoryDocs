# Claude Code General Agent for Finance

You've spent years mastering finance. You know the difference between a deferred expense and a prepaid asset without thinking. You can look at a variance report and immediately spot whether the 15% revenue increase is real growth or just timing differences.

But your tools don't understand any of this.

Your accounting software follows rules: "If vendor name contains 'AWS', categorize as Cloud Services." Your reconciliation tool matches amounts: "Bank amount equals ledger amount? Mark as matched." Your forecasting platform applies formulas: "Last year plus growth rate equals next year."

These tools execute logic. They don't understand what they're doing.

What if your finance tools could actually *reason* about financial data the way you do?

---

## Building on What You Learned in Chapter 5

In Chapter 5, you discovered something important: Claude Code isn't a coding assistant. It's a **General Agent**—an AI that observes problems, orients around constraints, decides on approaches, acts through commands, and corrects its mistakes autonomously.

You learned about the OODA loop:

1. **Observe**: "What's happening? Let me gather information."
2. **Orient**: "What patterns do I see? What's relevant here?"
3. **Decide**: "Given this context, what should I do?"
4. **Act**: Execute the decision
5. **Correct**: If it didn't work, adjust and try again

You also learned that "code is just how Claude controls your computer." Claude Code uses the terminal as its command center—not because it's limited to programming, but because code is the universal interface to the digital world.

Now let's apply that same General Agent concept to finance.

---

## The Financial Reasoning Engine

When Claude Code operates in your finance domain, it becomes what industry researchers call a **Financial Reasoning Engine**—a system that interprets intent, reasons over financial data, and assists with judgment-intensive tasks.

This isn't metaphor. It's a specific way of thinking about what Claude does differently than traditional finance tools.

### What Traditional Finance Tools Do

Traditional automation in finance is **rules-based**:

| Scenario | Rules-Based Response |
|----------|---------------------|
| Transaction: "AWS Invoice $2,340" | IF vendor = "AWS" THEN category = "Cloud Services" |
| Reconciliation: Bank $10,000 vs Ledger $10,000 | Amounts match? Mark reconciled |
| Variance: Revenue up 15% | Calculate difference, display percentage |
| Forecast: Next quarter revenue | Last quarter * (1 + growth rate) |

Rules engines execute predefined logic. They're fast, consistent, and predictable. But they don't *understand* anything.

### What Claude Code Does Differently

Claude Code **reasons** about financial data:

| Scenario | Reasoning-Based Response |
|----------|-------------------------|
| Transaction: "AWS Invoice $2,340 - Monthly cloud services for production infrastructure" | "This is an operating expense, likely recurring monthly. The 'production infrastructure' note suggests it should be allocated across cost centers. The amount increased from last month's $1,890—might indicate scaling that leadership should know about." |
| Reconciliation: Bank $10,000 vs Ledger $9,950 | "The $50 difference matches the pattern of wire transfer fees from First National Bank. This isn't an error—it's an expected cost that needs to be journalized. Here's the entry." |
| Variance: Revenue up 15% | "Revenue increased 15%, but examining the composition: new customer revenue is flat, while existing customer expansion accounts for the entire increase. This suggests strong retention but weak acquisition—different story than headline suggests." |
| Forecast: Next quarter revenue | "Based on pipeline data, seasonality patterns, and the macroeconomic indicators you mentioned, here are three scenarios with assumptions made explicit..." |

The difference isn't just better answers. It's a fundamentally different approach: **reasoning about meaning** rather than **executing rules**.

## Reasoning vs Rules: A Concrete Example

Consider this transaction that arrives in your accounts payable queue:

> **Invoice**: Acme Professional Services LLC
> **Amount**: $4,500
> **Description**: "Strategic consulting engagement - Phase 2 deliverables per SOW dated March 15"

### How a Rules Engine Handles This

A rules-based system looks for patterns:

1. Check vendor name against vendor master → No exact match for "Acme Professional Services LLC"
2. Check description for keywords → "consulting" found, map to "Professional Services" category
3. Check amount against approval thresholds → $4,500 requires manager approval
4. **Result**: Categorized as "Professional Services", routed for approval

The system processed the transaction. But it has no idea what actually happened.

### How Claude Code Handles This

Claude Code applies the OODA loop you learned in Chapter 5:

**Observe**: "I see an invoice from Acme Professional Services LLC for $4,500 referencing 'Phase 2 deliverables' and a Statement of Work dated March 15."

**Orient**: "Let me check the context. I see a previous invoice from 'Acme Professional Svcs' for $4,500 in April—likely the same vendor with slight name variation. The SOW reference suggests this is part of a contracted engagement, not a one-off expense. Phase 2 implies there was a Phase 1."

**Decide**: "I should match this to the existing vendor, check if the total engagement cost aligns with any approved contracts, and flag the Phase 2 nature for project tracking."

**Act**: "Here's my recommendation: Match to existing vendor Acme Professional Svcs (ID: V-2847). Categorize as Professional Services - Strategic Consulting. Link to Project: Q1 Strategy Initiative. Note: This is invoice 2 of a multi-phase engagement—verify total engagement cost against approved contract."

**Correct** (if needed): "You mentioned this should actually be capitalized as part of the software implementation project? Let me recategorize and update the project allocation."

The difference: Claude understood the *meaning* of the transaction, connected it to broader context, and provided judgment—not just execution.

## The Three-Layer Architecture

When you use Claude Code for finance, you're operating within a specific architecture that keeps intelligence and execution separate:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│          INTELLIGENCE LAYER                 │
│      (Claude Code - Reasoning Engine)       │
│   Interprets intent • Applies judgment      │
│   Suggests classifications • Explains why   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                     │
              Your Approval
                     │
                     ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│          EXECUTION LAYER                    │
│      (Spreadsheets / Accounting System)     │
│  Records transactions • Runs calculations   │
│  Maintains audit trail • Stores data        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                     │
                     ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│          GOVERNANCE LAYER                   │
│           (Human Oversight)                 │
│   Final approval • Exception handling       │
│   Compliance verification • Sign-off        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

This architecture matters because it preserves what makes finance work:

- **Intelligence layer** (Claude): Reasons, interprets, suggests—but doesn't directly modify financial records
- **Execution layer** (your systems): Maintains the official record with full audit trail
- **Governance layer** (you): Makes final decisions on anything material

This is **AI-assisted, human-governed** finance—not autonomous AI making financial decisions.

---

## The AI-Assisted, Human-Governed Model

The operating model for Claude Code in finance has clear boundaries:

| Component | What It Does | What It Doesn't Do |
|-----------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Claude Code** | Interprets ambiguous transactions, suggests classifications, explains variances, drafts narratives, identifies anomalies | Post transactions to ledgers, override controls, make tax decisions, approve material items |
| **Execution Systems** | Record transactions, maintain audit trails, calculate formulas, store official data | Reason about meaning, handle ambiguity, explain business context |
| **Human** | Approve recommendations, handle exceptions, make judgment calls, sign off on financials | Process every routine transaction, manually review every categorization |

### Why This Model Works

Finance requires both:
- **Reasoning**: Interpreting what a transaction *means*, not just what it *contains*
- **Control**: Maintaining audit trails, compliance, and human accountability

Traditional tools gave you control without reasoning. Trying to give AI full control would sacrifice accountability.

The AI-assisted, human-governed model gives you both: Claude reasons, you govern.

### What Claude Should Never Do

Clear boundaries protect you:

- **Never post transactions autonomously** to accounting systems
- **Never override accounting controls** or approval workflows
- **Never make tax decisions** without human review
- **Never replace human approval** on material items

When properly governed, Claude increases safety rather than reducing it—because it surfaces anomalies and explains reasoning that pure automation would miss.

## From Chapter 5 to Chapter 7

Here's how the concepts you mastered in Chapter 5 transform for finance:

| Chapter 5 Concept | Chapter 7 Application |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| **General Agent** | Financial Reasoning Engine that interprets intent, not just executes rules |
| **OODA Loop** | Observe financial data → Orient around business context → Decide on classification/action → Act on recommendation → Correct based on feedback |
| **Code as Universal Interface** | Financial queries, data extraction, report generation—all through natural language translated to execution |
| **Skills** (upcoming) | Finance-specific skills: variance-analyzer, transaction-classifier, reconciliation-assistant |
| **Subagents** (upcoming) | Financial Modeler, Scenario Analyst, Risk Assessor, Validator |

The General Agent concept doesn't change. The *domain* changes.

## Try With AI

Test your understanding of how General Agent reasoning applies to finance.

**Prompt 1: Experience the Reasoning Difference**

```
I have a transaction that needs classification:

Vendor: "TechServe Solutions Inc"
Amount: $8,750
Description: "Annual support and maintenance - License renewal plus implementation services for Q1 enhancements"

First, show me how a rules-based system would handle this (just pattern matching on keywords).

Then, show me how you would reason through this transaction step-by-step, explaining what questions you'd ask and what context you'd consider.
```

**What you're learning**: This prompt reveals the difference between rule execution and contextual reasoning. Notice how Claude identifies that this single invoice actually contains multiple expense types (support vs implementation) that might require different accounting treatment.

**Prompt 2: Apply the OODA Loop to Reconciliation**

```
I'm reconciling my bank account and found this discrepancy:

Bank statement shows: $45,230.00 (deposit on March 15)
Our AR ledger shows: Invoice #1847 for $45,000 paid on March 15

Walk me through your OODA loop reasoning:
- What do you OBSERVE?
- How do you ORIENT (what patterns or context matter)?
- What do you DECIDE to investigate?
- What ACTION would you take?
- What CORRECTION might be needed based on what you find?
```

**What you're learning**: This prompt lets you see the OODA loop from Chapter 5 applied to a real finance scenario. The $230 difference could be many things—interest, a partial payment, a bank fee, or a misposted transaction. Watch how Claude reasons through possibilities rather than just flagging "doesn't match."

**Prompt 3: Contrast Rules vs Reasoning in Your Domain**

```
Think about a financial workflow in my domain: [describe: month-end close / expense reporting / cash forecasting / audit preparation].

Give me two examples:
1. A task that SHOULD remain rules-based (where reasoning adds no value)
2. A task that BENEFITS from reasoning (where judgment and context matter)

For each, explain why that approach is appropriate.
```

**What you're learning**: This prompt helps you calibrate where reasoning-based AI adds value versus where simple automation is sufficient. Not every finance task needs Claude—some are genuinely better as rules. The skill is knowing the difference.

Note: This lesson introduced conceptual foundations. In the following lessons, you'll configure Claude Code for finance work (CLAUDE.md), create finance-specific Skills, connect to external systems via MCP, and ultimately build your Finance Digital FTE. The reasoning capability you explored here becomes practical through those components.
