### Core Concept
Before learning FastAPI, create a FastAPI skill using Context7 to fetch official documentation. Skill-first learning means owning the knowledge asset, then improving it throughout the chapter. One prompt creates a complete skill grounded in official docs, not AI memory.

### Key Mental Models
- **Skill-first learning**: Own the asset before studying details; each lesson tests and improves the skill
- **Documentation-grounded**: Context7 fetches official FastAPI docs—no hallucinated patterns
- **Clarifying questions**: AI asks about database preferences, auth patterns, deployment before building
- **Iterative improvement**: Skill improves as you learn—each lesson reveals gaps to fix

### Critical Patterns
- Clone skills-lab fresh (no state assumptions from prior chapters)
- Single prompt creates complete skill with references, templates, starter code
- Skill location: `.claude/skills/fastapi-dev/`
- "Reflect on Your Skill" section at each lesson end identifies gaps

### AI Collaboration Keys
- Use skill creator skill with Context7 for documentation fetching
- Let AI ask clarifying questions before building
- Test skill against each lesson's concepts
- Improve skill when gaps discovered

### Common Mistakes
- Using AI memory instead of official docs (leads to outdated patterns)
- Skipping clarifying questions (produces generic skill)
- Not testing skill throughout chapter (skill quality stagnates)

### Connections
- **Builds on**: Skill-first learning methodology (Part 6 pattern)
- **Leads to**: Hello FastAPI (Lesson 1)
