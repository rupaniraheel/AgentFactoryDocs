### Core Concept
AI collaboration accelerates chart development through iterative refinement: initial generation, critical evaluation, constraint teaching, and validation produce solutions superior to either AI patterns or human knowledge alone.

### Key Mental Models
- **Three-Phase Pattern**: Initial request -> Evaluation -> Constraint teaching creates productive dialogue
- **Context Over Patterns**: AI's generic suggestions become production-ready when you teach domain constraints
- **Critical Evaluation**: Review AI output against YOUR environment, not abstract best practices
- **Iterative Convergence**: Neither first response nor initial request is sufficient; refinement is the method

### Critical Patterns
- Initial request: Describe requirements without over-constraining
- Evaluation questions: What matches? What assumptions did AI make? What's missing?
- Constraint teaching: Share infrastructure specifics, team practices, operational model
- Validation: Compare refined output against actual requirements

### AI Collaboration Keys
- Teach AI your specific ingress controller, GitOps model, team size
- Challenge assumptions in AI responses (e.g., webhook middleware)
- Request patterns, not just code (apply learning to similar problems)

### Common Mistakes
- Accepting AI's first response without critical evaluation
- Not teaching AI about specific infrastructure constraints
- Expecting "perfect first try" instead of iterative refinement

### Connections
- **Builds on**: Lessons 1-9 provide domain knowledge for evaluating AI suggestions
- **Leads to**: Lesson 11 (Capstone) applies collaboration pattern at scale
