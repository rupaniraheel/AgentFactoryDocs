# Using Community MCP Servers

You understand MCP architecture. You can configure clients. Now comes the practical question: **What servers actually exist, and how do you choose between them?**

The MCP ecosystem has grown rapidly. There are reference servers maintained by Anthropic, community-created servers for specialized tasks, and enterprise servers from companies like Sentry and Datadog. This abundance is powerful—but it creates a discovery and evaluation challenge.

How do you find servers? How do you know if a community server is maintained or abandoned? What security risks come with installing code from unknown authors? When should you build a custom server versus adapting an existing one?

This lesson covers the entire server lifecycle: discovery through the official registry, evaluation criteria, installation and configuration, and composition into powerful multi-server workflows. By the end, you'll know how to build development environments that combine filesystem access, GitHub integration, database queries, and web search into a unified agent ecosystem.

## The MCP Ecosystem: Official, Community, and Enterprise

The MCP server landscape has three tiers:

### Official Reference Servers (Maintained by Anthropic / The Linux Foundation)

These servers are vetted, well-documented, and receive security updates. They demonstrate MCP capabilities and serve as reference implementations.

**Key official servers**:

| Server | Purpose | Status | Best For |
|--------|---------|--------|----------|
| **Filesystem** | Read/write local files, create directories, search | Reference implementation | File-based workflows, development environments |
| **GitHub** | Repository operations, issues, PRs, workflows | Official (owned by GitHub) | Version control, issue tracking, CI/CD integration |
| **Git** | Generic git operations (different from GitHub) | Reference implementation | Low-level repository manipulation |
| **Fetch** | HTTP requests, web content fetching | Reference implementation | API integration, web scraping |
| **Memory** | Persistent knowledge graph across sessions | Reference implementation | Long-term context retention |
| **Everything** | Test/reference server with all capabilities | Reference implementation | Development, testing, learning |

**Where to find them**: [github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers)

**Why use official servers**:
- Security reviews and vulnerability patches
- Stable APIs and well-defined behavior
- Complete documentation
- Community adoption (you're not alone debugging issues)

### Community Servers (Created and Maintained by Developers)

The community has created thousands of MCP servers for specialized domains: databases, monitoring tools, AI platforms, analytics, and more.

**Popular community servers** (maintained as of 2025):

| Server | Purpose | Maintenance | Language |
|--------|---------|-------------|----------|
| **SQLite** / **PostgreSQL** | Database query and manipulation | Active | Python |
| **Puppeteer** / **Playwright** | Browser automation | Active | Node.js / Python |
| **Brave Search** | Web search without tracking | Active | Node.js |
| **Slack** | Send messages, manage channels | Community-maintained | Python |
| **Linear** | Issue tracking, project management | Active | Python |
| **AWS** | EC2, S3, Lambda operations | Community-maintained | Python |
| **Sentry** | Error monitoring and debugging | Active | Python |
| **Datadog** | Metrics, logs, monitoring | Community-maintained | Python |
| **Google Docs** | Read/write documents | Community-maintained | Python |
| **Jira** | Project management, ticket operations | Community-maintained | Python |

**Where to find community servers**:
1. **Official MCP Registry** at [registry.modelcontextprotocol.io](https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io) — The authoritative source with metadata and ratings
2. **Curated lists** on GitHub (e.g., [wong2/awesome-mcp-servers](https://github.com/wong2/awesome-mcp-servers), [punkpeye/awesome-mcp-servers](https://github.com/punkpeye/awesome-mcp-servers))
3. **GitHub search** for "mcp-server" repository topic

**Important caveat**: Community servers are not officially vetted. Security, maintenance, and documentation vary widely.

### Enterprise Servers (Built by Companies for Their Platforms)

Companies like Sentry, Datadog, Linear, and others have built official MCP servers for their platforms. These sit between community (unsupported) and official (fully maintained) servers.

**Characteristics**:
- Built and maintained by the company (not community volunteers)
- Focus on their specific platform
- Commercial support available (usually)
- Security and stability important (these companies are accountable)

## Evaluating Server Quality and Trust

Not all community servers are created equal. Some are production-ready; others are abandoned experiments. Here's how to evaluate:

### Evaluation Checklist

Before installing any server, assess:

**1. Official vs Community Status**
- Official (Anthropic/Linux Foundation maintained) = Highest trust
- Enterprise (Sentry/Datadog/etc.) = High trust (company accountability)
- Community = Variable (evaluate further)

**2. Maintenance Activity**
Check the repository:
- **Last commit date**: Within last 3 months = Active; Within last year = Maintained but slow; >1 year = Likely abandoned
- **Open issues**: How many? Are they being addressed?
- **Pull request velocity**: Are contributions being reviewed and merged?

**3. Security Considerations**
Review what the server can do:
- **What system resources does it access?** (files, network, environment variables)
- **What operations are destructive?** (writes, deletes, modifications)
- **Can it expose secrets?** (in logs, error messages, returned data)
- **What permissions does it require?** (API keys, database credentials)

**Risk framework**:
```
Low Risk:  Read-only operations on non-sensitive data
Medium Risk: Modifications or access to non-secret resources
High Risk: System access, secret management, destructive operations
```

**4. Code Review Red Flags**
If you can read the code:
- Does it validate inputs before using them in system commands?
- Does it log secrets or sensitive data?
- Does it handle errors gracefully or expose internal details?
- Does it limit scope to documented capabilities?

**5. Documentation Quality**
- Clear README with examples?
- List of all available tools/resources?
- Configuration examples for each platform?
- Troubleshooting guide?

**Example**:
```
GitHub MCP Server:
- Official: YES (GitHub owns it now, Anthropic created it)
- Maintenance: Active (multiple commits per week)
- Risk: Medium (requires GitHub token, can create/modify issues)
- Documentation: Excellent (full tool reference, examples)
Verdict: SAFE TO USE
```

```
Hypothetical "SuperAI-Master" server:
- Official: NO (random GitHub user)
- Maintenance: Last commit 18 months ago
- Risk: UNKNOWN (code is obfuscated/minified)
- Documentation: Missing (just one-liner description)
Verdict: AVOID (too many unknowns)
```

## Installation: npm vs uvx vs Docker

MCP servers are distributed as packages. Installation depends on runtime:

### Node.js Servers (via npx)

Most official servers are Node.js:

```bash
# Install and run directly (no global install needed)
npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem /path/to/serve

# In configuration (JSON), reference the package
"command": "npx",
"args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/path/to/serve"]
```

**Advantages**:
- No global installation needed (npx downloads on-demand)
- Works across platforms (macOS, Linux, Windows)
- Easy to upgrade (npx always gets latest)

**Disadvantages**:
- First run is slow (downloads package)
- Requires Node.js installed
- Internet needed for first run

### Python Servers (via uvx)

Python-based servers (common in community):

```bash
# Install and run via uvx
uvx mcp-sqlite

# With Python version specification
uvx --python 3.12 mcp-github

# In configuration
"command": "uvx",
"args": ["mcp-sqlite"]

# Or with Python version
"command": "uvx",
"args": ["--python", "3.12", "mcp-github"]
```

**Advantages**:
- Works with isolated Python environments (no global pollution)
- Automatic dependency management
- Clean uninstall (just delete directory)

**Disadvantages**:
- Slower than pre-installed (downloads/installs on first run)
- Requires uvx (from uv package manager)

### Docker Servers (for Complex Setups)

For servers with heavy dependencies:

```bash
# Build and run Docker container
docker run -e GITHUB_TOKEN=$GITHUB_TOKEN mcp-github:latest
```

**When to use Docker**:
- Server has complex dependencies (database drivers, system libraries)
- You want guaranteed environment consistency
- Deploying to production (Kubernetes, etc.)

## Popular Servers: Configuration Examples

Let's configure the most commonly-used community servers.

### Filesystem Server (Official)

Already covered in Lesson 6, but listed here for completeness:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/Users/you/projects"]
    }
  }
}
```

### GitHub Server (Official, owned by GitHub)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "github": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_TOKEN": "${GITHUB_TOKEN}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**What it enables**:
- Create issues, pull requests
- Fetch repository information
- Manage workflows and deployments
- Search across repositories

**Setup**:
1. Create GitHub Personal Access Token (Settings → Developer Settings → Personal Access Tokens)
2. Create with scopes: `repo`, `read:org`, `workflow`
3. Store in `.env`: `GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_xxxx`

### Brave Search Server (Community, Actively Maintained)

Web search without tracking:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "search": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-brave-search"],
      "env": {
        "BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY": "${BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**What it enables**:
- Web search (news, web results)
- Query summarization
- Fact verification

**Setup**:
1. Get API key from [api.search.brave.com](https://api.search.brave.com)
2. Free tier available (limited requests)
3. Store in `.env`: `BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY=xxx`

### SQLite Server (Community, Popular)

Local database queries:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sqlite": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["mcp-sqlite", "/path/to/database.db"]
    }
  }
}
```

**What it enables**:
- Query tables
- Create/modify records
- Schema inspection

**Setup**:
1. Point to existing SQLite database file
2. No authentication needed (file-based)
3. Restricted to single database

### PostgreSQL Server (Community)

Remote database operations:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "database": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["mcp-postgres"],
      "env": {
        "DATABASE_URL": "${DATABASE_URL}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**What it enables**:
- Query multiple tables
- Create/update/delete records
- Run stored procedures

**Setup**:
1. Create connection string: `postgresql://user:password@host:5432/database`
2. Store in `.env`: `DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...`
3. Ensure network access (firewall rules, VPN)

### Puppeteer Server (Community: Browser Automation)

Automated browser interaction:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "browser": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["mcp-puppeteer"]
    }
  }
}
```

**What it enables**:
- Navigate to URLs
- Fill forms
- Click buttons
- Take screenshots
- Extract content

**No authentication needed** (but can slow down operations).

## Composing Multiple Servers: Building Complex Workflows

The power of MCP emerges when you combine servers. A single agent can work across filesystem, GitHub, databases, and web search simultaneously.

### Example: Multi-Server Development Environment

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/Users/you/project"]
    },
    "github": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_TOKEN": "${GITHUB_TOKEN}"
      }
    },
    "sqlite": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["mcp-sqlite", "/Users/you/project/data.db"]
    },
    "search": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-brave-search"],
      "env": {
        "BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY": "${BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**What this enables**:

An agent using this configuration can:
1. **Read project files** (filesystem server) → Understand codebase structure
2. **Check GitHub issues** (GitHub server) → See what needs fixing
3. **Query local database** (SQLite server) → Understand data schema
4. **Search the web** (Brave server) → Find API documentation or examples
5. **Execute multi-step workflows**:
   - "Read the TODO.md file, search for examples of how others solved this, create a GitHub issue with the findings, update the database schema"

### Tool Routing: How Agents Know Which Server to Use

When you ask an agent to perform a task, the client automatically routes it to the right server:

```
Agent: "Search for OAuth 2.0 examples in Node.js"
↓
Client checks all servers for search-related tools
↓
Brave Search server has `search()` tool
↓
Client calls Brave server with query
↓
Returns results

Agent: "Create an issue in the GitHub repo"
↓
Client checks all servers for GitHub-related tools
↓
GitHub server has `create_issue()` tool
↓
Client calls GitHub server with issue data
↓
Returns issue URL
```

Each server exposes its own tools. The agent sees ALL tools from ALL connected servers. This creates a powerful unified interface.

### Workflow Example: Bug Report → GitHub Issue → Database Update

Here's what a multi-server workflow looks like:

**Agent request**:
```
"I found a bug in the user authentication. Help me:
1. Search for similar issues already reported
2. Create a new GitHub issue with detailed description
3. Update the bugs table in our database with this issue
4. Draft a fix proposal based on code review"
```

**Workflow execution**:

1. **Search** (Brave Search server) → Find similar issues + relevant code patterns
2. **Create Issue** (GitHub server) → Open issue with title, description, labels
3. **Update Database** (SQLite server) → Add bug report to tracking table
4. **Code Review** (Filesystem server) → Read relevant files to understand auth logic
5. **Synthesis** → Agent combines all information to propose fix

None of this requires explicit server selection. The agent requests capabilities (search, create issue, database write, file read) and the client routes to the right servers.

## Security Considerations for Community Servers

Community servers require more caution than official servers.

### Risk Assessment Framework

**Before installing any community server, ask**:

1. **What does it do?** (Read code or documentation)
2. **What could go wrong?** (Worst-case execution)
3. **How is it sandboxed?** (What limits prevent damage?)

**Examples**:

```
Scenario 1: Community Filesystem Server (Hypothetical)
- What: Reads/writes files to specific directory
- Could go wrong: Server exploit → attacker writes malicious code
- Sandbox: Restricted to single directory (limited scope)
- Risk: MEDIUM (containable)
- Mitigation: Use official filesystem server instead (better security review)

Scenario 2: Database Server
- What: Connects to PostgreSQL with stored credentials
- Could go wrong: Leaked database URL → attacker accesses all data
- Sandbox: Database user permissions (e.g., read-only)
- Risk: HIGH (contains sensitive data)
- Mitigation: Use database user with minimal privileges; rotate credentials regularly

Scenario 3: Web Search Server
- What: Makes HTTP requests to search API
- Could go wrong: None (read-only operation, no state change)
- Sandbox: Search server can only return results (no side effects)
- Risk: LOW (benign operation)
- Mitigation: Verify API key not exposed in logs
```

### Security Checklist for Community Servers

- [ ] Is this server still maintained? (Check last commit date)
- [ ] Does it have security vulnerabilities? (Check GitHub issues and releases)
- [ ] What permissions does it need? (API keys, file access, database credentials)
- [ ] Can it expose secrets? (Check if it logs credentials or returns them)
- [ ] Have you code-reviewed it? (Read the source for obvious issues)
- [ ] Is there a less-risky alternative? (Official vs community, simpler vs complex)
- [ ] Can you sandbox it? (Restricted permissions, isolated environment)

## Discovering New Servers and Staying Updated

The MCP ecosystem evolves constantly. How do you stay informed?

### Official MCP Registry

**Best source**: [registry.modelcontextprotocol.io](https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io)

The registry launched in preview (September 8, 2025) and entered API freeze v0.1 (October 24, 2025). It's the canonical source for:
- Server metadata (author, version, capabilities)
- Community ratings and reviews
- Installation instructions
- Links to repositories

### Community Curated Lists

Popular GitHub repositories maintain curated lists:
- [wong2/awesome-mcp-servers](https://github.com/wong2/awesome-mcp-servers)
- [punkpeye/awesome-mcp-servers](https://github.com/punkpeye/awesome-mcp-servers)

These lists are community-maintained (not official) but useful for discovery and recommendations.

### Following Updates

Once you identify servers you use:
- **Watch the repository** on GitHub (get notifications for releases)
- **Subscribe to release notes** (many servers publish security advisories)
- **Monitor CVE databases** (for security vulnerabilities in dependencies)

## Try With AI

Use your AI companion to explore the MCP server ecosystem, evaluate options, and design multi-server configurations.

### Security Note on Community Servers

When installing and configuring community MCP servers, remember:
- **Official servers are vetted**: Use them by default (Filesystem, GitHub, Fetch, Memory)
- **Community servers require judgment**: Check maintenance status, code review, and security implications before deploying
- **Credentials are high-risk**: Community server vulnerability → leaked API keys → compromised accounts
- **Sandbox principles apply**: Give servers only the permissions they need (read-only when possible, restricted database users, limited file access)
- **Monitor actively**: Set up alerts for security issues in servers you depend on; rotate credentials regularly if using community servers

The convenience of community servers must be balanced against security responsibility. Start with official servers. Only add community servers after evaluating alternatives and understanding risks.

### Prompt 1: Discover Servers for Your Use Case

**Setup**: Finding the right server for your project needs

```
I'm working on a project that needs to:
1. Read and modify code files in /my/project
2. Interact with GitHub (create issues, comment on PRs)
3. Query a local SQLite database of project metadata

Help me:
1. Identify which MCP servers would be useful
2. For each server, explain what it does and what I need to set it up
3. List any authentication/credentials I need to create
4. Explain how these servers work together in a single configuration
```

**What you're learning**: Server discovery and selection based on project requirements.

### Prompt 2: Evaluate Server Quality

**Setup**: Comparing options for the same task

```
I need database access for my AI agent. I found three servers:
1. Official SQLite server from modelcontextprotocol/servers
2. Community PostgreSQL server (last updated 2 weeks ago, 50 GitHub stars)
3. Another community PostgreSQL server (last updated 1 year ago, 200 stars)

Help me evaluate:
1. What are the trust/maintenance/security differences?
2. What questions would you ask about each before using it in production?
3. Which would you recommend and why?
4. What are the risks of picking the "wrong" one?
```

**What you're learning**: Evaluating server quality and making risk-based decisions.

### Prompt 3: Configure Multiple Servers

**Setup**: Building a multi-server configuration

```
I want to set up a development environment with these servers:
- Filesystem (to read project files)
- GitHub (to check issues and create PRs)
- Brave Search (to find examples)
- SQLite (for project database)

Help me:
1. Write the complete JSON configuration (.claude/settings.json)
2. List all the environment variables I need and where to get them
3. Show me how to create a .env file with these secrets
4. Explain how to test each server to verify it's working
5. What should I NEVER commit to git? Why?
```

**What you're learning**: Multi-server configuration, authentication management, and security best practices.

### Prompt 4: Design a Complex Workflow

**Setup**: Using multiple servers together

```
I have a feature request that requires:
1. Reading code from my project (filesystem)
2. Searching for similar implementations online (web search)
3. Creating a GitHub issue with the requirements
4. Adding task records to my SQLite database
5. Drafting implementation code

For this workflow:
1. Which servers would you use? Why?
2. In what order would you invoke them?
3. What could go wrong? How would you handle failures?
4. How would you test this end-to-end?
```

**What you're learning**: Multi-server workflow design and failure mode analysis.
