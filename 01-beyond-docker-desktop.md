# Beyond Docker Desktop

Your AI agent runs perfectly on your laptop. Docker Desktop starts it in seconds, `localhost:8000` responds, everything works. You're ready for production.

Except you're not.

Production means your agent serves real users, handles real traffic, and operates when you're asleep. Docker Desktop was designed for development, not for running 24/7 services that customers depend on.

This lesson explains why Docker Desktop can't serve production workloads, what managed Kubernetes services offer instead, and when self-managing your own cluster makes financial sense. By the end, you'll understand how to evaluate cloud providers using the cost-control-operations triangle.

---

## Why Docker Desktop Isn't Production

Docker Desktop excels at local development. But production requires capabilities Docker Desktop was never designed to provide.

### The Single-Node Problem

Docker Desktop runs everything on your laptop—one machine. Production requires:

| Requirement | Docker Desktop | Production Reality |
|-------------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Machine count** | 1 (your laptop) | 3-100+ nodes |
| **Failure isolation** | None—laptop dies, everything dies | Workloads survive node failures |
| **Geographic distribution** | Impossible | Users in Tokyo need nearby servers |
| **Horizontal scaling** | Add containers on same machine | Add machines to handle load |

When your laptop closes, Docker Desktop stops. Your "production" service disappears.

### No High Availability

High availability means your service stays up when components fail. Docker Desktop provides zero high availability:

- **No redundancy**: One container instance, one failure point
- **No automatic failover**: Container crashes → manual restart
- **No health redistribution**: Can't move workloads to healthy nodes (there are no other nodes)

Real production systems expect components to fail. They're designed so failures don't become outages.

### Local Networking Only

Docker Desktop networking exists only on your machine:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                YOUR LAPTOP                       │
│                                                  │
│  ┌──────────┐      ┌──────────┐                │
│  │ Frontend │ ──── │ Backend  │                │
│  │ :3000    │      │ :8000    │                │
│  └──────────┘      └──────────┘                │
│                                                  │
│  Works perfectly here...                        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                     │
                     ▼
            But how do users reach it?
```

In production, users need to reach your services from the internet. That requires:

- **Load balancers** to distribute traffic
- **DNS** to map domain names to IP addresses
- **TLS certificates** for HTTPS
- **Ingress controllers** to route requests

Docker Desktop doesn't provide any of these. It's not designed to.

### The Development-to-Production Gap

```
Development (Docker Desktop)          Production (What You Need)
─────────────────────────────          ──────────────────────────
One machine                            Multiple machines across regions
You restart crashed containers         System automatically restarts them
localhost:8000                         api.yourcompany.com with TLS
No backups (it's on your laptop)       Automated backups, disaster recovery
Free (included with Docker)            Real infrastructure costs money
```

Docker Desktop is a development tool. Treating it as production infrastructure is like using a bicycle as an ambulance—it's the wrong tool for the job.

## Managed Kubernetes: Let Someone Else Handle the Control Plane

Managed Kubernetes services run the control plane for you. You focus on deploying workloads; they handle the infrastructure that makes Kubernetes work.

### What "Managed" Means

In Chapter 50, you learned Kubernetes has two parts:

1. **Control plane**: API server, scheduler, etcd, controller manager—the "brains"
2. **Worker nodes**: Where your containers actually run—the "muscles"

Managed Kubernetes means the provider operates the control plane:

| Component | You Manage | Provider Manages |
|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Control plane** | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Worker nodes** | ✅ | ❌ |
| **Your containers** | ✅ | ❌ |
| **Networking between nodes** | Partial | Partial |
| **Cluster upgrades** | Trigger when ready | Execute upgrade |

**You get**: A working Kubernetes API endpoint. Run `kubectl get nodes` and see your cluster.

**They handle**: etcd backups, API server availability, scheduler health, control plane upgrades, security patches.

### Major Managed Kubernetes Providers (December 2025)

| Provider | Service | Control Plane Cost | Minimum Monthly Cost | Best For |
|----------|---------|-------------------|---------------------|----------|
| **DigitalOcean** | DOKS | Free (or $40 for HA) | ~$24 (2 nodes @ $12) | Startups, learning, cost-sensitive projects |
| **Microsoft** | AKS | Free | Node costs only | Azure-integrated enterprises |
| **Google** | GKE | Free (zonal) / $72 (regional) | ~$74 for Autopilot | Kubernetes-native teams, ML workloads |
| **Amazon** | EKS | $72/month | ~$72 + node costs | AWS-integrated enterprises |

**Pricing source**: DigitalOcean, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and Amazon Web Services pricing pages (December 2025).

### DigitalOcean Kubernetes (DOKS)

DOKS offers the simplest path to managed Kubernetes:

- **Free control plane** (or $40/month for high-availability control plane)
- **Worker nodes from $12/month** (shared CPU)
- **Pooled bandwidth**: 2 TB per node included
- **99.95% uptime SLA** on HA control plane

**Minimum viable cluster**: 2 nodes at $12 each = **$24/month**.

**Best for**: Side projects, startups, and teams who want Kubernetes without enterprise complexity.

### Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Microsoft's managed Kubernetes integrates deeply with Azure:

- **Free control plane management** in most regions
- **Only pay for compute, storage, and networking**
- **Virtual nodes** for serverless bursting
- **Spot instance support** for cost optimization

**Best for**: Organizations already using Azure, .NET workloads, enterprises with Microsoft agreements.

### Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)

Google invented Kubernetes; GKE reflects that heritage:

- **Free control plane for zonal clusters** (single zone)
- **$72/month for regional clusters** (multi-zone, HA)
- **Autopilot mode**: Google manages nodes too—pay only for pod resources
- **Lowest storage costs**: $0.04/GB/month for persistent disks

**Best for**: Teams wanting the most Kubernetes-native experience, ML/AI workloads with TPU access.

### Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)

AWS's offering integrates with the AWS ecosystem:

- **$72/month control plane fee** (flat, regardless of cluster size)
- **Deep AWS integration**: IAM, VPC, CloudWatch, etc.
- **EKS Anywhere**: Run EKS on your own hardware
- **Fargate support**: Serverless containers (pay per pod)

**Best for**: AWS-heavy organizations, enterprise compliance requirements.

## Self-Managed Kubernetes: Maximum Control, Maximum Responsibility

Some teams run Kubernetes themselves on affordable cloud providers. This trades operational simplicity for cost savings and control.

### Hetzner + K3s: The Budget Option

Hetzner offers some of the cheapest cloud VMs in the industry:

| Instance | vCPUs | RAM | Storage | Price (EU) |
|----------|-------|-----|---------|------------|
| CX22 | 2 | 4 GB | 40 GB NVMe | ~$4/month |
| CX32 | 4 | 8 GB | 80 GB NVMe | ~$8/month |
| CX42 | 8 | 16 GB | 160 GB NVMe | ~$16/month |
| CCX13 (dedicated) | 2 | 8 GB | 80 GB NVMe | ~$15/month |

**K3s** is a lightweight Kubernetes distribution that runs on small VMs. A minimal production cluster:

```
Hetzner K3s Cluster (Self-Managed)
─────────────────────────────────────
1x CX22 (control plane)      $4/month
2x CX22 (worker nodes)       $8/month
─────────────────────────────────────
Total:                       ~$12/month
```

Compare to managed DOKS at $24/month—you save 50%. But what do you give up?

### What "Self-Managed" Actually Means

With self-managed Kubernetes, YOU handle:

| Task | Managed (DOKS/GKE/EKS) | Self-Managed (Hetzner + K3s) |
|------|----------------------|----------------------------|
| **Control plane availability** | Provider | You |
| **etcd backups** | Provider | You |
| **Kubernetes upgrades** | Provider (you trigger) | You (manual) |
| **Security patches** | Provider | You |
| **Node OS updates** | You (or provider) | You |
| **Networking setup** | Mostly provider | Entirely you |
| **Certificate management** | Provider | You |
| **Monitoring/alerting** | Your workloads | Everything |

If your etcd data corrupts at 3 AM, there's no support ticket to file. You fix it or your cluster is gone.

### When Self-Managed Makes Sense

Self-managed Kubernetes works when:

1. **You have Kubernetes expertise** on your team (not learning as you go)
2. **Cost savings are significant** (10+ nodes makes the ops overhead worthwhile)
3. **You need control** over every aspect (compliance, custom networking)
4. **Downtime tolerance is higher** (internal tools, not customer-facing SaaS)

Self-managed doesn't make sense when:

1. **Your team is small** (1-3 engineers managing everything)
2. **You're learning Kubernetes** (managed providers handle the hard parts)
3. **Uptime is critical** (99.9% SLA is easier with managed)
4. **Saving $15/month** isn't worth operational risk

## The Cost-Control-Operations Triangle

Every cloud infrastructure decision involves three competing priorities:

```
                     COST
                      /\
                     /  \
                    /    \
                   /      \
                  / Choose \
                 /   Two    \
                /____________\
           CONTROL          OPERATIONS
           (Flexibility)    (Simplicity)
```

**Cost**: How much you spend monthly
**Control**: How much you can customize and configure
**Operations**: How much work you do to keep it running

### Pick Two (You Can't Have All Three)

| Priority Pair | What You Get | What You Sacrifice |
|---------------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Cost + Control** | Hetzner + K3s | Operational simplicity (you manage everything) |
| **Cost + Operations** | DigitalOcean DOKS | Some control (fewer features than AWS/GKE) |
| **Control + Operations** | AWS EKS | Higher cost (pay for both power and convenience) |

### Applying the Triangle

**Startup with 2 engineers, building MVP**:
- Prioritize: **Cost + Operations**
- Choice: DigitalOcean DOKS at $24/month
- Reasoning: Can't afford to spend engineering time on infrastructure

**Scale-up with dedicated DevOps, 50 services**:
- Prioritize: **Control + Operations**
- Choice: AWS EKS or GKE
- Reasoning: Need deep integrations, willing to pay for managed control plane

**Agency running client projects, predictable workloads**:
- Prioritize: **Cost + Control**
- Choice: Hetzner + K3s
- Reasoning: Expertise exists, saving $500/month across clients adds up

## Provider Selection Decision Matrix

Use this matrix when your `multi-cloud-deployer` skill needs to recommend infrastructure:

| Scenario | Recommended Provider | Reasoning |
|----------|---------------------|-----------|
| **Learning Kubernetes** | DOKS | Cheapest managed option, simple UI, good docs |
| **AWS-heavy organization** | EKS | Native integration with existing AWS services |
| **Azure-heavy organization** | AKS | Free control plane, Azure AD integration |
| **ML/AI workloads needing GPUs** | GKE | Best TPU/GPU support, ML-focused features |
| **Extreme cost sensitivity + Kubernetes expertise** | Hetzner + K3s | $12/month for full cluster |
| **Startup scaling rapidly** | GKE Autopilot | Don't manage nodes, pay per pod, scale automatically |
| **Compliance-heavy enterprise** | EKS or AKS | Audit logging, compliance certifications, enterprise support |

### Questions Your Skill Should Ask

Before recommending a provider, your `multi-cloud-deployer` skill should consider:

1. **What cloud services do you already use?** (AWS? Azure? None?)
2. **How much Kubernetes experience does your team have?**
3. **What's your monthly infrastructure budget?**
4. **How critical is uptime?** (Side project vs revenue-generating service)
5. **Do you need specific features?** (GPUs, serverless containers, custom networking)

---

## Cost Reality Check (December 2025)

Let's compare running a small production workload across providers:

### Scenario: 3-Node Cluster for API Service

| Provider | Control Plane | 3 Worker Nodes | Monthly Total |
|----------|--------------|----------------|---------------|
| **Hetzner + K3s** | $4 (you run it) | $12 (3x CX22) | ~$16 |
| **DigitalOcean DOKS** | $0 | $36 (3x $12 basic) | ~$36 |
| **AKS** | $0 | ~$40 (3x B2s) | ~$40 |
| **GKE (zonal)** | $0 | ~$50 (3x e2-small) | ~$50 |
| **EKS** | $72 | ~$40 (3x t3.small) | ~$112 |

**Note**: Actual costs vary by region, instance type, and discounts. Always use provider calculators for accurate estimates.

### Hidden Costs to Consider

The sticker price isn't everything:

| Hidden Cost | Impact |
|-------------|--------|
| **Load balancers** | $10-20/month per service exposed |
| **Persistent storage** | $0.04-0.10/GB/month |
| **Data transfer (egress)** | $0.08-0.12/GB after free tier |
| **Backups** | Varies by provider |
| **Monitoring/logging** | Free tiers exist, but scale quickly |
| **Your time** | Hours spent on infrastructure vs product |

A "cheap" self-managed cluster becomes expensive if you spend 10 hours/month maintaining it. At $100/hour engineering cost, that's $1000 in hidden labor.

## Try With AI

Test your understanding of production infrastructure tradeoffs:

**Prompt 1: Docker Desktop limitations**

```
My teammate says we can just keep using Docker Desktop for our demo next week.
We have 3 microservices that need to communicate. The demo is for investors.
What could go wrong? What would you recommend instead?
```

**What you're learning**: How to articulate why development tools aren't suitable for even demo production scenarios. The "laptop closes, demo dies" scenario is real.

**Prompt 2: Provider recommendation**

```
I'm a solo developer building a SaaS product. I know Docker but I'm new to Kubernetes.
My monthly infrastructure budget is $50. I need the service available 99% of the time.
Which cloud provider should I use and why?
```

**What you're learning**: How to apply the cost-control-operations triangle. For learning + cost sensitivity + uptime needs, DOKS is likely the answer.

**Prompt 3: Self-managed evaluation**

```
My company has 5 DevOps engineers and we're running 40 services on AWS EKS.
The EKS control plane fee alone is $72/month per cluster, and we have 3 clusters.
Should we migrate to Hetzner + K3s to save money? What factors should we consider?
```

**What you're learning**: The self-managed tradeoff analysis. $216/month in control plane fees might not justify the operational overhead for a team already on AWS.

**Safety note**: Always validate cloud provider pricing before committing. Prices change, regions vary, and promotional pricing expires. Use official pricing calculators for accurate estimates.

---

## Reflect on Your Skill

Test your `multi-cloud-deployer` skill against what you learned:

### Test Your Skill

```
Using my multi-cloud-deployer skill:
1. Explain why Docker Desktop isn't production-ready
2. Show the cost-control-operations triangle tradeoffs
3. Recommend a provider for a startup with $30/month budget and no Kubernetes experience
```

### Identify Gaps

Ask yourself:
- Does my skill include the managed vs self-managed distinction?
- Does it cover the cost comparison matrix?
- Can it explain WHY a particular provider fits a scenario?

### Improve Your Skill

If gaps exist:

```
My multi-cloud-deployer skill needs provider selection guidance.
Update it to include:
1. The cost-control-operations triangle framework
2. Provider comparison matrix (DOKS, AKS, GKE, EKS, Hetzner+K3s)
3. Questions to ask before recommending infrastructure
```
