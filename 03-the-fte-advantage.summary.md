### Core Concept
Digital FTEs deliver 50x cost efficiency compared to human labor ($3 per ticket vs $150), but the real advantage is economic justification through three tests: volume (high/repetitive), accuracy tolerance (can early inaccuracy be managed?), and economic jolt (savings significant enough to tolerate mistakes).

### Key Mental Models
- **Three Economic Scenarios**: Human replacement (direct cost savings), capacity expansion (capturing revenue that would be lost), and misaligned economics (when liability risk exceeds cost savings)
- **Volume-Accuracy-Economics Tests**: Decision framework determining whether a Digital FTE is strategically justified for a specific use case
- **Shadow Mode to Autonomous Mode**: Start with human oversight at 78% accuracy, improve to 94%+ before autonomous operation

### Critical Patterns
- Quantify current pain before proposing solutions (headcount cost, tickets handled, cost per unit)
- Model the accuracy/reliability tradeoff transparently (Month 1 accuracy vs Month 6 accuracy)
- Structure financial pitch around annual savings, not monthly costs ($164K annual savings vs $1,300/month expense)
- Position as "Digital FTE" not "chatbot" or "automation tool"—the framing changes client perception entirely

### Common Mistakes
- Deploying Digital FTEs for low-volume, high-judgment work where accuracy tolerance is near-zero
- Hiding accuracy limitations instead of transparently discussing shadow mode tuning period
- Building solutions for domains where the economic jolt isn't compelling enough to justify even temporary mistakes

### Connections
- **Builds on**: Expertise positioning (Lesson 1) and competitive layer assessment (Lesson 2)
- **Leads to**: Monetization model selection (Lessons 5-6)
