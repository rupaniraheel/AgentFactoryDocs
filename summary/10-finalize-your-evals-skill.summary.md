### Core Concept
A skill proves its worth when it transfers beyond the context where you learned it. Validate your agent-evals skill by applying it to a completely different agent domain - if it helps without returning to chapter content, you own something valuable.

### Key Mental Models
- Skill portability: Patterns learned on Task API should work on Customer Support, Code Review, or any agent type
- Framework-agnostic concepts: Binary criteria, error analysis, regression protection transfer across all SDKs
- Framework-specific details: Trace access, built-in graders, CI/CD integration require adaptation per SDK
- Skills evolve through use: Today's finalized skill is not the final version - update as you encounter new patterns

### Critical Patterns
- Skill validation checklist: Can skill help with Dataset Design, Grader Creation, Error Analysis, and Component vs E2E Decision?
- Complete skill documentation: Core Thesis, When to Activate (8+ triggers), Core Patterns with templates, Framework Application table
- Portable patterns: Evals vs TDD, binary criteria, three-category datasets, spreadsheet method
- Test on third agent type: If you complete dataset + grader + component identification without chapter content, skill is production-ready

### AI Collaboration Keys
- Test skill portability by applying evaluation methodology to a completely different domain
- Generate domain-specific eval datasets using the three-category framework
- Create graders for different quality criteria using binary decomposition

### Common Mistakes
- Freezing the skill and never updating it (living skills grow stronger with use)
- Assuming framework-specific details transfer (trace access, built-in graders vary by SDK)
- Not testing skill on multiple agent types before considering it complete
- Missing sections in SKILL.md documentation (gaps cause skill failure when needed most)

### Connections
- **Builds on**: Lessons 00-09 (Complete chapter content crystallized into portable skill)
- **Leads to**: Applying agent-evals skill to future agent projects across any framework
