### Core Concept
A Finance Digital FTE combines all chapter components—Skills, MCP connections, Subagents, and Governance—into a complete system that handles end-to-end finance workflows. This isn't just a productivity tool; it's a **sellable asset** that packages your finance expertise into a product. The core logic (variance analysis, classification, risk assessment) remains constant; configuration adapts to each client's context.

### Key Mental Models
- **Four-Layer Architecture**: Skills (reusable intelligence) + MCP (external systems) + Subagents (specialized roles) + Governance (safety rails)—remove any layer and system loses capability
- **From Builder to Seller**: Building is one skill; productizing requires articulating value, identifying customization points, and documenting for users without your context
- **Customization vs Core Logic**: Your 10 years of variance analysis expertise is the unchanging core; chart of accounts, thresholds, approval hierarchies are per-client configuration
- **Time Compression**: Workflows that take human teams hours compress to minutes of AI execution plus focused human review

### Key Facts
- **Component inventory for Digital FTE**: CLAUDE.md (domain context), 2-3 Skills with full specs, MCP integration design, Subagent orchestration plan, Governance checklist, Complete workflow specification
- **Four capstone options**: Monthly Financial Health Checkup, Accounts Receivable Aging, Budget vs Actual Reporting, Cash Flow Forecasting
- **Packaging options**: Skill license (individual skills), Workflow template (complete spec + skills), Managed service (full FTE + support), Custom build (bespoke for enterprise)
- **Production validation areas**: Data security, reliability, compliance, maintenance

### Critical Patterns
- **Workflow specification template**: Trigger conditions → Input requirements → Processing steps → Output formats → Success criteria → Error handling
- **Capstone deliverables checklist**: CLAUDE.md, 2-3 Skills with SKILL.md files, MCP integration design, Subagent orchestration plan, Governance checklist, Complete workflow spec, Sample outputs
- **Customization points**: CLAUDE.md (chart of accounts, policies), Skills (confidence levels, formats), MCP (credentials, mappings), Subagents (personas, sequencing), Governance (approval hierarchies)

### Common Mistakes
- Building components in isolation without integration testing (month-end close needs all pieces working together)
- Skipping the workflow specification document (undocumented systems can't be maintained or sold)
- Ignoring production deployment considerations (security, reliability, compliance) until too late
- Treating capstone as "just a project" instead of prototype for sellable product

### Connections
- **Builds on**: All 9 previous lessons (each provides a component layer), Chapter 1 (Digital FTE concept), Chapter 5 (Skills, MCP, Subagents foundations)
- **Leads to**: Production deployment of finance automation, selling finance expertise as packaged AI systems, building complete Agent Factory portfolio
