### Core Concept
Build a Docker deployment skill BEFORE learning Docker, creating an asset you own and will improve throughout the chapter using AI and official documentation.

### Key Mental Models
- **Skill-First Learning**: Create the capability first, then learn to improve it through the chapter lessons
- **Documentation-Grounded Skills**: Skills built from official docs via Context7 are more reliable than AI memory
- **Owned Assets**: The skill you create belongs to you and represents accumulated expertise
- **Progressive Refinement**: Each lesson reveals gaps in your skill that you then fix

### Critical Patterns
- Clone skills-lab fresh for each chapter (no state assumptions)
- Use skill creator skill to generate new skills from official documentation
- Ask AI clarifying questions to customize skill for your use case
- Skills live in `.claude/skills/` directory

### AI Collaboration Keys
- Use natural language prompts to create skills
- Leverage Context7 for official documentation fetching
- Answer AI's clarifying questions to customize output

### Common Mistakes
- Assuming AI memory is sufficient (use official docs instead)
- Skipping skill creation and jumping to manual learning
- Not specifying your use case (Python/FastAPI containerization)

### Connections
- **Builds on**: Part 6 FastAPI agent development, Claude Code skills framework
- **Leads to**: Lesson 1 (Docker Installation) where you test and improve your skill
