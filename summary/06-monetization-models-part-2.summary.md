### Core Concept
License and Marketplace models serve different market segments: License targets enterprises requiring data sovereignty and compliance ($25K-50K+ annually), while Marketplace offers volume plays through platform distribution with passive discovery but 70% revenue split to the platform.

### Key Mental Models
- **License Economics**: High margin (76%) but long sales cycles (3-6 months), best for regulated industries where data cannot leave customer infrastructure
- **Marketplace Economics**: Low customer acquisition cost but brutal discoverability and high churn; need 167 users at $3/user/month just to break even
- **Portfolio Strategy**: Combine models as you grow—Marketplace for acquisition funnel, Subscription for serious buyers, License for enterprise

### Critical Patterns
- Choose License when compliance/data sovereignty is critical (HIPAA, SOC 2, GDPR)
- Choose Marketplace when discovery through platforms is realistic and passive income appeals
- Hybrid Strategy: Success Fee to Subscription upgrade, Marketplace to Subscription upgrade, or Subscription plus License for different customer segments
- Position License as "compliance-friendly, self-hosted, your data never leaves" vs Marketplace as "integrated, one-click, no contracts"

### Common Mistakes
- Using Marketplace for specialized verticals that need relationship-based trust and enterprise sales
- Underestimating License model support burden (self-hosted systems fail in unexpected ways)
- Expecting Marketplace discoverability without consistent maintenance and review management
