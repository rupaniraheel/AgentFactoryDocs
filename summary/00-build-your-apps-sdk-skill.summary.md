### Core Concept
Before learning OpenAI Apps SDK, create an Apps SDK skill using Context7 to fetch official documentation. ChatGPT Apps with interactive widgets provide 800M+ user distribution. One prompt creates a complete skill grounded in official docs.

### Key Mental Models
- **Skill-first learning**: Own the asset before studying details; improve throughout chapter
- **Distribution opportunity**: Build once, reach 800M ChatGPT users via App Directory
- **Documentation-grounded**: Context7 fetches official Apps SDK docs—no hallucinated patterns
- **Widget vs MCP**: Apps SDK adds visual layer on top of MCP servers

### Critical Patterns
- Clone skills-lab fresh (no state assumptions from prior chapters)
- Single prompt creates complete skill with references, templates, starter code
- Skill location: `.claude/skills/openai-apps-sdk/`

### AI Collaboration Keys
- Use skill creator skill with Context7 for documentation fetching
- Let AI ask about widget types, interactivity patterns, display modes
- Test skill against each lesson's concepts as you learn

### Common Mistakes
- Using AI memory instead of official docs (leads to outdated patterns)
- Skipping clarifying questions (produces generic skill)
- Confusing Apps SDK with Agents SDK (different purposes)

### Connections
- **Builds on**: MCP Fundamentals (Chapter 37), Custom MCP Servers (Chapter 38)
- **Leads to**: Apps SDK Architecture (Lesson 1)
