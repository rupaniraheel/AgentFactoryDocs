# Capstone — Intelligence Acceleration

This capstone proves that skill reuse accelerates work. By writing a second paper section using the `section-writer` skill YOU created in Lesson 9, you demonstrate measurable acceleration: the second section takes 70 minutes instead of 3.5 hours. This is not just about speed—it's about understanding how YOUR skill enables velocity gains. You'll measure this acceleration concretely, recognize why it happens, and understand how skills become valuable assets. This lesson answers the central question: Can you complete a task faster using a skill you've built? The answer is yes, and you'll have the data to prove it.

## Mental Models

- **Skill-Based Acceleration**: Each skill YOU create encodes patterns into reusable SKILL.md format (at `.claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`). The second task using that skill doesn't rediscover patterns—AI discovers and applies them. Lesson 8 takes 3.5 hours from scratch; Lesson 11 takes 70 minutes because AI finds and follows YOUR skill. This is reasoning reuse—YOUR documented workflows applied at increasing velocity.

- **Specification Simplification Through Skills**: When you build the first section, your specification must detail all decision points. For the second section with YOUR skill, your specification shrinks to just intent, constraints, and success criteria. The upstream complexity—how to write academically, how to validate claims—is now encapsulated in YOUR skill that YOU invoke.

- **Skills as YOUR Assets**: Traditional reuse focuses on code libraries. YOUR skills are different. Your `section-writer` skill (at `.claude/skills/section-writer/SKILL.md`) encodes your workflow, quality criteria, and process steps. When AI discovers this skill, it applies YOUR reasoning patterns.

- **Skills vs PHRs**: PHRs are auto-created within a project and stay there (YOUR learning record). Skills are user-created after good sessions and can be invoked in future work. PHRs document what happened; Skills are active tools the agent uses.

## Key Patterns

- **Acceleration Measurement**: Time tracking creates evidence. First section (Lesson 8): 3.5 hours from scratch. Second section (Lesson 11): 70 minutes using YOUR skill. This 65% time reduction proves that YOUR skill works.

- **Skill Invocation**: When implementing, mention the skill and AI discovers it automatically through its description. The AI follows YOUR process steps and quality criteria from the SKILL.md file. YOU're not creating new reasoning patterns—YOU're applying YOUR proven patterns.

- **Specification Simplification**: Compare your first spec (detailed everything) to your second spec (simpler). Why? YOUR skill already solved "how to structure academic writing." Your new specification just names what success looks like—YOUR skill handles how.

- **Reflection-Driven Insight**: Pause and document why acceleration happened. What patterns did YOUR skill encode? What decisions did YOU not have to make because the skill handled them? This reflection embeds understanding of why skills compound.

## Common Mistakes

- **Confusing Speed with Skill Benefit**: The mistake is thinking Lesson 11 is faster just because you're experienced. Without YOUR skill, the second section would still take 2-3 hours. With YOUR skill, it takes 70 minutes. The difference is YOUR skill, not just experience.

- **Creating Skills Too Specific**: Build skills that are domain-general (`section-writer` for any academic writing), not domain-specific ("climate change research skill"). Domain-general skills work across future projects.

- **Skipping Reflection**: The real learning happens when YOU document why the second section was faster. By measuring and articulating acceleration, YOU embed understanding of why skills work.

- **Not Invoking Skills Explicitly**: Skills don't apply automatically. YOU must invoke them. YOU tell the AI "use my section-writer skill" and provide the skill content.

## Progression Context

- **Builds on**:
  - Lesson 3: Constitution (quality standards)
  - Lesson 4: First specification (becomes foundation)
  - Lessons 6-8: Planning, tasks, implementation (where patterns emerged)
  - Lesson 9: Skill creation (where YOU built the section-writer skill)
  - Lesson 10: Brownfield adoption theory

- **Leads to**:
  - **Future Projects**: YOU invoke YOUR skill on similar tasks
  - **Skill Library Growth**: YOU create more skills as YOU recognize patterns worth encoding
  - **Team Value**: YOUR skills can help team members if YOU share them
  - **Competitive Advantage**: YOUR skill library makes YOU faster than starting from scratch
