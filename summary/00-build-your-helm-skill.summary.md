### Core Concept
Build a Helm chart skill from official documentation before learning Helm, so you own a reusable asset that you will improve throughout the chapter.

### Key Mental Models
- **Skill-First Learning**: Create the skill before learning the technology, then improve it as you learn
- **Documentation-Grounded Skills**: Skills built from official docs are more reliable than memory-based ones
- **Owned Assets**: Students graduate with skills they own, not just knowledge they acquired
- **Iterative Improvement**: Each lesson tests and enhances the skill you created

### Critical Patterns
- Clone skills-lab fresh to avoid state assumptions
- Use Context7 to fetch official Helm documentation
- Let Claude ask clarifying questions about templating complexity
- Skill appears at `.claude/skills/helm-chart/`

### AI Collaboration Keys
- Use natural language prompt to create skill
- AI fetches documentation and asks clarifying questions
- Skill creation is conversational, not prescriptive

### Common Mistakes
- Skipping the skill creation and jumping directly to lessons
- Creating skills from memory instead of official documentation
- Not testing the skill against real chart requirements

### Connections
- **Builds on**: Skills-lab setup from previous chapters
- **Leads to**: Lesson 1 (Introduction to Helm) where you test your skill
