### Core Concept
The M-shaped developer maintains deep, production-level expertise across 2-4 complementary domains—not shallow generalist knowledge, but genuine mastery in multiple areas, enabled by AI augmentation through the nine pillars.

### Key Mental Models
- **Domain Complementarity**: Choose domains that compound each other—Frontend + Backend + DevOps work together because they're sequential steps in one workflow. ML + Data Engineering + Backend combine because they share data pipelines.
- **Capability Multiplier**: AI dramatically expands what's possible for individuals, but it doesn't replace good judgment, execution quality, or earned expertise in critical areas.
- **Profile Distinction**: M-shaped (multiple deep peaks) differs from T-shaped (one deep peak + shallow breadth) and generalist (broad but shallow everywhere).

### Critical Patterns
- Select 2-4 domains that naturally reinforce each other for the products you want to build
- Each of the nine pillars removes a specific barrier to multi-domain mastery (AI agents fill knowledge gaps, SDD maintains quality outside comfort zones, universal tools reduce learning overhead)
- Respect realistic constraints: safety-critical systems, regulatory compliance, and advanced research still require traditional deep expertise

### Common Mistakes
- Treating M-shaped as "knowing everything"—it's strategic complementary depth, not arbitrary breadth
- Assuming AI replaces earned expertise in critical domains like security, compliance, or safety-critical systems
- Choosing domain combinations that don't reinforce each other (fundamentally different mental models don't compound)
