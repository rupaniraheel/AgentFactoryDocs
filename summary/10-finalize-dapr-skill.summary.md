### Core Concept
Finalize your Dapr skill by testing it against real scenarios, filling gaps discovered during the chapter, and preparing it for production use in your Digital FTE portfolio.

### Key Mental Models
- **Skill Validation**: Test your skill against the capstone to identify gaps
- **Iterative Improvement**: Update skill based on lessons learned
- **Production Readiness**: Add resiliency, observability, and security patterns
- **Portfolio Asset**: The skill is a sellable component of your Digital FTE

### Critical Patterns
- Test skill against each building block learned in the chapter
- Identify and document gaps in the skill's knowledge
- Update skill with missing patterns and configurations
- Verify skill generates production-quality output

### AI Collaboration Keys
- Ask your Dapr skill to solve the capstone problems
- Identify where the skill falls short and improve it
- Use Claude to verify skill output against official docs

### Common Mistakes
- Skipping skill validation and assuming it's complete
- Not updating the skill with patterns learned in the chapter
- Forgetting to test the skill with production scenarios

### Connections
- **Builds on**: Lesson 9 - Capstone Task API integration
- **Leads to**: Chapter 54 - CI/CD and GitOps with ArgoCD
