### Core Concept
Build an MCP server skill before writing code. Clone skills-lab, prompt Claude with Context7 to fetch official MCP documentation, answer clarifying questions, and receive a complete skill at `.claude/skills/mcp-server-builder/`. The rest of the chapter teaches you to improve it.

### Key Mental Models
- **Skill-first learning**: Own the skill BEFORE learning details—then improve it with each lesson
- **Documentation-grounded**: Skill built from official docs via Context7, not memory
- **Fresh start each chapter**: Clone skills-lab fresh to avoid state assumptions
- **LEARNING-SPEC pattern**: Define what you're learning before creating the skill

### Critical Patterns
- Skills lab: `github.com/panaversity/claude-code-skills-lab`
- Skill creation prompt: "Using your skill creator skill create a new skill for building MCP servers"
- Context7 integration: "Use context7 skill to study official documentation"
- Skill output: `.claude/skills/mcp-server-builder/`

### AI Collaboration Keys
- Claude fetches MCP docs, asks clarifying questions, builds complete skill
- Each lesson tests and improves your skill
- "Reflect on Your Skill" sections at lesson end guide improvement

### Common Mistakes
- Skipping the skill creation step and jumping straight to code
- Assuming prior knowledge instead of building from official docs
- Not testing the skill before moving to lessons

### Connections
- **Builds on**: Chapter 37 (MCP Fundamentals)
- **Leads to**: Context Object & Server Lifespan (Lesson 1)
