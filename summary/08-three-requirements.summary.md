### Core Concept
Vertical market success requires three interdependent capabilities working in sync: domain expertise (via fine-tuned models OR vertical intelligence), deep integrations with existing systems, and complete agentic solutions. Missing any one element causes failure—not diminished results, but actual failure.

### Key Mental Models
- **Two Paths to Domain Expertise**: Path 1 (fine-tuned models) for deep pattern recognition from large datasets; Path 2 (vertical intelligence via sub-agents and skills) for faster iteration with procedural workflows
- **All-or-Nothing Interdependence**: Domain expertise + integrations without agentic solution = data pipeline. Expertise + agentic solution without integrations = sandbox demo. Integrations + agentic solution without expertise = wrapper competitors replicate in weeks.
- **Intelligence as Competitive Asset**: Accumulated knowledge (whether encoded as fine-tuned models or vertical intelligence) is the moat—competitors must invest months rebuilding what you've learned

### Critical Patterns
- Rate yourself 1-10 on each requirement before committing to build
- Use fine-tuning when you have large domain datasets and subtle patterns; use vertical intelligence when expertise is procedural and you need faster iteration
- Partner with domain experts if your Domain Expertise score is below 7; start with one platform if Integration score is low
- Study competitor solutions and conduct customer discovery if Solution Design score is low

### Common Mistakes
- Attempting Phase 3 pivot without all three requirements in place (the OpenAI Study Mode lesson: partially meeting requirements creates features, not products)
- Choosing between fine-tuning and vertical intelligence based on perceived defensibility (both create moats; choose based on resources and timeline)
- Underestimating that deep integrations require months of API work, regulatory approvals, and relationship-building
