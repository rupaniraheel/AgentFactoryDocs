### Core Concept
Your domain expertise is not something AI tools enhance—it IS the product. The shift from tool user to product builder transforms how you capture value: instead of trading time for money, you encode your expertise into Digital FTEs that work 24/7 and serve multiple customers simultaneously.

### Key Mental Models
- **Consumer vs Builder**: Tool users ask "How can AI help me work faster?" while builders ask "How can I encode my expertise into a product others can use?"
- **The 20% Moat**: Generic AI handles 80% of domain work adequately, but the 20% requiring judgment, constraint knowledge, and failure pattern recognition is where specialists create defensibility
- **Time vs Leverage**: Human labor scales linearly (40 hours/week) while Digital FTEs multiply your expertise across unlimited instances

### Critical Patterns
- Identify constraint knowledge that generic AI lacks (which rules are actually enforced vs. ignored)
- Recognize failure pattern recognition from experience (common mistakes you've seen repeatedly)
- Articulate context specificity (how domain rules change based on organization size, industry segment, etc.)
- Build network effects through vertical credibility (specialists in healthcare build trust with hospital CTOs)

### Common Mistakes
- Positioning AI as a productivity tool instead of positioning your expertise as the sellable product
- Competing on prompt engineering skill ("I know ChatGPT better") rather than domain depth
- Underestimating how long it takes competitors to replicate deep domain knowledge (6-12 months minimum)

### Connections
- **Builds on**: Digital FTE vision and Spec-Driven Development from Chapter 1
- **Leads to**: Competitive layer assessment (Lesson 2) and FTE economics (Lesson 3)
