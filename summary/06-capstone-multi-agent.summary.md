### Core Concept
Build a production-ready multi-agent AI system demonstrating true parallel reasoning on multiple CPU cores using free-threaded Python. This capstone synthesizes all prior lessons: CPython architecture, GIL mechanics, performance optimization, free-threading capabilities, and concurrency decision-making into one coherent project. The system IS the benchmark—measuring itself while operating, demonstrating both functional correctness and performance optimization.

### Key Mental Models
**Agent Definition**: Independent computational unit accepting input, performing reasoning (CPU-bound), producing output with metadata, and reporting timing. **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Agent pool launches threads independently, all execute in parallel (with free-threading), shared results container collects outputs thread-safely, coordinator validates results. **Traditional vs Free-Threaded**: Traditional Python 4 agents on 4 cores = 12 seconds (sequential); free-threaded 4 agents on 4 cores = 3 seconds (4x speedup).

### Critical Patterns
Thread-safe result collection using locks or thread-safe data structures. Free-threading detection via `sys._is_gil_enabled()` and fallback behavior for both scenarios. Comprehensive benchmarking comparing single-threaded baseline, traditional threading, free-threaded, and multiprocessing approaches. Error resilience: one agent failure doesn't crash system. Performance metrics collection: execution time, CPU utilization, memory usage, speedup calculations.

### AI Collaboration Keys
Request scaffolded foundation code: AIAgent class, AgentResult dataclass, thread-safe container, main launch function. Have AI help design benchmarking dashboard showing real-time speedup comparison. Ask AI to explain scaling: how does single-machine multi-threading pattern connect to Kubernetes pods and Ray distributed actors (Parts 11, 14)? Request error handling patterns: graceful degradation when agents fail.

### Common Mistakes
Not measuring single-threaded baseline (can't prove parallelism helps). Forgetting thread-safe synchronization (race conditions in shared state). Using too few agents to justify free-threading overhead. Not detecting and handling agent failures (brittle system). Measuring wall-clock time incorrectly (need to separate agent execution from coordination overhead).

### Connections
Synthesizes CPython architecture understanding (Lesson 1): knows why reference counting matters for thread safety. Applies performance optimization knowledge (Lesson 2): recognizes where 5% interpreter improvement multiplies. Demonstrates GIL solution (Lesson 4): free-threading enables parallelism impossible in traditional Python. Applies decision framework (Lesson 5): chooses free-threaded approach because workload is CPU-bound with parallelism opportunities. Gateway to production systems (Parts 11, 14): patterns scale from single machine to Kubernetes and Ray clusters.
