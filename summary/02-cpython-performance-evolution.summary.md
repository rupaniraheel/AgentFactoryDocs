### Core Concept
Python 3.14 compounds interpreter optimizations (tail-call dispatch, incremental garbage collection, deferred annotations) achieving 3–5% baseline speedup. For AI workloads running billions of operations, 5% translates to 30+ minutes saved per 10-hour inference pipeline. Performance improvement happens not through radical changes but through consistent, measurable optimization of foundational bytecode execution.

### Key Mental Models
**Bytecode Dispatch Overhead**: Interpreter fetches, decodes, and dispatches each instruction—overhead compounds. Tail-call optimization recognizes frequent instruction patterns and creates fast paths. **Incremental GC**: Traditional garbage collection pauses entire program (stop-the-world, 50–100ms). Incremental GC splits work into tiny chunks (3–5ms pauses) interleaved with program execution—total work unchanged, but latency dramatically reduced. **Pause Time vs Throughput**: Real-time AI systems (chatbots, agents) care about latency (response time); batch systems care about throughput (total time).

### Critical Patterns
Measure performance improvements with pyperformance benchmarks (real-world applications, not micro-benchmarks). Calculate compound effects: 5% + 5% + 5% from different optimizations = ~15% total. Understand deferred annotations reduce import time for modules with hundreds of type hints—critical for container startups. Python 3.14 trades 5–10% single-threaded overhead for optional free-threading (Lesson 4), enabling true parallelism.

### AI Collaboration Keys
Ask AI to show concrete calculations: "1 billion operations × 5% speedup = how much time saved?" Request pyperformance benchmark results comparing Python versions. Have AI explain latency impact on real-time systems (e.g., 2.5ms saved per agent decision × 1 million decisions = 2,500 seconds per day). Explore garbage collection mechanics: when does incremental GC matter vs when is throughput more important?

### Common Mistakes
Assuming 5% speedup is negligible (it compounds at scale). Confusing interpreter performance with library performance (NumPy/TensorFlow are mostly C code—Python 3.14 helps orchestration, not computation). Ignoring pause times (thinking only about total throughput). Not measuring baseline before claiming optimization works.

### Connections
Builds on CPython architecture (Lesson 1): optimizations target bytecode dispatch, memory management. Precedes GIL discussion (Lesson 3): faster interpreter makes GIL limitations more visible. Sets stage for free-threading (Lesson 4): 5–10% overhead is acceptable when parallelism gains are 2–10x. Drives concurrency choices (Lesson 5): micro-optimizations justify workload classification and benchmarking discipline.
