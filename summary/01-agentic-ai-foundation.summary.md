### Core Concept
AAIF (Agentic AI Foundation) is a Linux Foundation initiative where competitors (OpenAI, Anthropic, Block) collaborate on open standards for AI agents—ensuring the infrastructure is neutral and portable, not locked to any single platform.

### Key Mental Models
- **USB Analogy**: Just as USB standardized device connections so any device works with any port, AAIF standardizes agent connections so skills and tools work across all AI platforms
- **Build Once, Deploy Anywhere**: Open standards mean your Digital FTEs are investments that work everywhere, not platform prisoners requiring rewrites
- **Three Projects, Three Problems**: MCP (connectivity), AGENTS.md (project context), goose (reference implementation)

### Critical Patterns
- MCP enables agents to connect to external tools (CRM, databases, APIs)
- AGENTS.md provides project-specific guidance (coding conventions, build commands)
- goose proves these standards work at enterprise scale (50-75% time savings at Block)
- Platinum members include direct competitors (AWS, Google, Microsoft, OpenAI)—signaling industry commitment

### Common Mistakes
- Assuming open standards mean "less powerful"—AAIF standards are production-tested at enterprise scale
- Building custom integrations for each AI platform instead of using MCP once
- Ignoring AGENTS.md and expecting agents to guess project conventions

### Connections
- **Builds on**: Agent Factory vision and Digital FTE concept (Chapter 1)
- **Leads to**: Deep dive into MCP, AGENTS.md, goose, and Agent Skills (Lessons 2-5)
