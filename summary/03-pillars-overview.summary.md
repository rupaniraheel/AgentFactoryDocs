### Core Concept
The nine pillars are integrated technologies and practices that work together as a system—each removes a specific development barrier, but their real power emerges from interdependencies that enable individual developers to accomplish what previously required specialist teams.

### Key Mental Models
- **Pillars as Infrastructure**: Each pillar solves one problem (tool integration, platform consistency, quality confidence), but together they create a complete development system
- **Interdependency Multiplier**: Pillars amplify each other—AI coding agents become far more effective with AI-first IDEs, TDD, and MCP tool access working together
- **Bottleneck Detection**: Missing pillars create specific gaps—removing any pillar degrades the system; removing several returns you to traditional specialist-silo development

### Critical Patterns
- Map each pillar to the barrier it removes (e.g., MCP → tool integration complexity, TDD → fear of breaking things)
- Trace dependencies between pillars before deciding what to learn next
- Prioritize pillars strategically based on your current tools and goals—not all nine matter equally for every developer
- Use the "remove three pillars" thought experiment to identify which interdependencies matter most for your work

### Common Mistakes
- Treating pillars as independent tools rather than an integrated system
- Attempting to master all nine simultaneously instead of strategic sequencing
- Removing pillars without understanding what workflow gaps will appear
- Focusing on individual pillar features without grasping cross-pillar dependencies

### Connections
- **Builds on**: AIDD's defining characteristics (specification-driven, AI-augmented, quality-gated)
- **Leads to**: Individual pillar deep-dives and M-shaped developer concept (Section 5)
