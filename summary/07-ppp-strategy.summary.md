### Core Concept
The Piggyback Protocol Pivot (PPP) is a three-phase market entry strategy: Phase 1 (3-6 months) builds the infrastructure bridge between fragmented incumbent systems, Phase 2 (6-12 months) validates with 60-80 customers while proving unit economics, and Phase 3 layers intelligent agents to pivot from bridge to super orchestrator.

### Key Mental Models
- **Infrastructure Layering**: Become the indispensable bridge connecting fragmented systems (Canvas + Blackboard + Google Classroom) rather than replacing incumbents
- **CAC Reduction Through Piggybacking**: 60-80% lower customer acquisition cost because you're an add-on, not a replacement—clients aren't asked to rip-and-replace
- **Pivot Trigger Criteria**: Ready when you have 60-80 active accounts with >90% retention, predictable MRR growing 10-15% month-over-month, and clear workflow understanding

### Critical Patterns
- Phase 1: Build MCP integrations with 3-5 incumbent platforms; solve fragmentation pain without threatening incumbents
- Phase 2: Collect workflow data showing which automations matter; build decision-maker relationships that become Phase 3 advocates
- Phase 3: Layer Custom Agents on validated workflows; transform from data aggregator to decision automator
- Incumbents can't respond quickly due to legacy code, regulatory delays, and misaligned incentives

### Common Mistakes
- Rushing to Phase 3 features before proving customers want the bridge (Phase 2 customer intimacy is the moat)
- Underinvesting in Phase 2 learning—the 6-12 months of listening to customers becomes your competitive advantage
- Assuming Phase 1 requires integrating with all platforms immediately; start with the most popular, expand later

### Connections
- **Builds on**: Monetization models (Lessons 5-6) and competitive positioning (Lesson 2)
- **Leads to**: Three requirements for vertical success (Lesson 8)
