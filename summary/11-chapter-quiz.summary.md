### Core Concept
The Chapter 3 quiz assesses understanding of Digital FTE strategy frameworks across six dimensions: expertise positioning, competitive layers, FTE economics, vertical intelligence architecture, monetization models (all four), PPP market entry, three requirements for success, and guardrails for appropriate automation.

### Key Mental Models
- **Expertise Positioning**: Your domain knowledge is the moat competitors cannot replicate; AI is the execution tool
- **Five-Component Architecture**: System prompts, horizontal skills, vertical skills, MCP horizontal connections, MCP vertical connections—with vertical MCP connections creating the highest defensibility
- **Disposable Code vs Permanent Intelligence**: Generate code per-application (AI handles this), reuse domain knowledge (your moat)

### Critical Patterns
- Choose monetization model based on measurability (Success Fee requires measurable outcomes) and data sovereignty requirements (License for regulated industries)
- PPP Phase 2 requires 60-80 customers to prove market fit, validate unit economics, and build advocate relationships for Phase 3
- Three requirements are interdependent: missing any one causes failure, not just diminished results
- Guardrails are non-negotiable in regulated industries: audit trails for HIPAA/SOC 2/PCI-DSS, human authorization for high-stakes decisions

### Common Mistakes
- Confusing Layer 2 (developer tools with feature-parity competition) defensibility with Layer 3 (vertical markets with relationship-based moats)
- Assuming Marketplace model works for specialized verticals that need relationship-based enterprise sales
- Skipping Phase 2 customer intimacy and rushing to Phase 3 features before proving customers want the bridge

### Connections
- **Builds on**: All Chapter 3 lessons and Pause and Reflect synthesis (Lesson 10)
- **Leads to**: Part 2 implementation of Digital FTE strategies
