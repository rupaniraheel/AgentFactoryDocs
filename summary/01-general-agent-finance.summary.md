### Core Concept
Claude Code is not just a coding tool—it's a **General Agent** that becomes a **Financial Reasoning Engine** when applied to finance. Unlike rules-based automation that executes predefined logic, Claude reasons contextually about financial data, interprets business intent, and provides judgment-assisted analysis while humans maintain governance.

### Key Mental Models
- **Rules Engine vs Reasoning Engine**: Traditional finance tools execute "if transaction contains AWS, categorize as Cloud Services." Claude reasons: "AWS Invoice for production infrastructure = operating expense, likely recurring, may need cost center allocation, worth flagging scaling costs to leadership"
- **Three-Layer Architecture**: Intelligence (Claude reasons) → Execution (Spreadsheets compute) → Governance (Humans approve). Never collapse these layers
- **AI-Assisted, Human-Governed**: Claude suggests and explains; humans verify and decide. This isn't about replacing financial judgment—it's about amplifying it
- **Intent-Driven vs Interface-Driven**: Express "model conservative revenue scenario" in natural language; Claude translates to financial logic. No more manual formula building

### Key Facts
- **Source**: Agentic Financial Planning whitepaper, Claude + Xero whitepaper
- **Paradigm shift**: From "systems to agents, from models to intent, from manual analysis to cognitive automation"
- **Operating model**: "AI-assisted, human-governed accounting" (Claude_Xero.pdf)

### Critical Patterns
- Claude interprets intent ("why did expenses exceed budget?") and reasons through possible causes step-by-step
- Financial Reasoning Engine capabilities: interpret unstructured documents, classify transactions with context, generate audit-ready explanations, detect anomalies, challenge assumptions
- Separation of responsibilities: Claude reasons → Accounting system records → Human approves

### Common Mistakes
- Thinking Claude replaces financial judgment (it amplifies, not replaces)
- Expecting rules-based accuracy (Claude reasons contextually, so outputs need human verification)
- Allowing autonomous ledger modifications (Claude should NEVER post transactions without human approval)
- Confusing "faster" with "better" (the value is reasoning quality, not speed)

### Connections
- **Builds on**: Chapter 5 General Agent concept, OODA reasoning loop
- **Leads to**: Finance workspace setup with CLAUDE.md, creating finance-specific Skills
