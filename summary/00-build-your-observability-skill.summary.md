### Core Concept
Build an observability-cost-engineer skill from official Prometheus, OpenTelemetry, and Loki documentation before learning the tools, enabling you to generate PromQL queries, instrumentation code, and dashboards throughout the chapter.

### Key Mental Models
- **Skill-First Learning**: Build the skill before learning content, then refine it as you progress through lessons
- **Documentation-Grounded Knowledge**: Skills based on official docs are more accurate than memory-based prompts
- **Learning Spec**: Define what you want to learn and success criteria before skill creation
- **Iterative Improvement**: Each lesson tests and extends your skill with new patterns

### Critical Patterns
- Clone skills-lab repository fresh before starting each chapter
- Write LEARNING-SPEC.md defining what to learn and success criteria
- Use /fetching-library-docs to ground skill in Prometheus, OpenTelemetry, and Loki official documentation
- Test skill with PromQL query generation before proceeding to lessons

### AI Collaboration Keys
- Ask Claude to fetch official documentation for Prometheus, OpenTelemetry, and Loki
- Request skill creation with metrics, tracing, logging, and cost patterns
- Have AI explore your debugging experience to identify which pillar would help most

### Common Mistakes
- Skipping the LEARNING-SPEC.md and jumping straight to skill creation
- Using AI memory instead of official documentation for skill content
- Not testing the skill before moving to subsequent lessons

### Connections
- **Builds on**: Chapter 54 - CI/CD and GitOps with ArgoCD
- **Leads to**: Lesson 1 - Three Pillars of Observability
