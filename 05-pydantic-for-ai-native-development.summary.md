### Core Concept

AI is probabilistic—it generates output that looks correct but may have subtle defects. Pydantic validates LLM-generated JSON, catching type mismatches, missing fields, and format violations. The validation-driven iteration loop (generate → validate → analyze errors → improve prompt → retry) transforms unreliable AI output into trusted structured data, enabling production-grade AI-native systems.

### Key Mental Models

**Probabilistic Generation Meets Deterministic Validation**: AI suggests outputs; Pydantic certifies them. This duality is fundamental: AI provides candidate solutions quickly; validation ensures they're correct before use. Combined, they enable rapid, reliable workflows.

**Error Messages as Prompt Feedback**: When Pydantic validation fails with "prep_time_minutes: Input should be a valid integer," that message directly improves your next prompt: "prep_time_minutes must be an integer (e.g., 30, not '30 minutes')." Validation errors are actionable refinement signals.

**Iterative Refinement as Default Strategy**: Assuming first-attempt AI output is always correct is naive. Design for iteration: validate once, improve prompt based on errors, regenerate. Often 2-3 iterations converge on valid output. Build retry loops into your architecture.

**LLM Output Validation Patterns Recur**: Type errors ("30" instead of 30), missing fields, unexpected extra fields, format violations—these patterns repeat. Understanding common mistakes prevents them through prompt clarity.

### Critical Patterns

**model_validate_json() for Direct Parsing**: Use `Model.model_validate_json(json_string)` to parse and validate in one step. It's faster and cleaner than `json.loads()` + `Model(**dict)`. Always wrap in try-except to handle ValidationError.

**Progressive Prompt Improvement**: Start with simple prompts. Add constraints only when validation reveals problems. Iterate: vague prompt → validation error → improved prompt → retry. This empirical approach beats trying to write perfect prompts upfront.

**FastAPI Integration (Zero Code)**: When building APIs, Pydantic validates request/response automatically. No validation code needed—declare models, FastAPI handles validation, returning 422 errors for invalid input before your code runs.

**Logging Validation Failures**: Always log what went wrong. Validation error logs are diagnostic gold—they reveal patterns in prompt problems, enabling systematic improvement over time.

### AI Collaboration Keys

This lesson is where Pydantic becomes essential for AI-native development. Validation isn't error handling; it's the core control loop: AI generates candidates; Pydantic certifies them; errors drive prompt refinement. Without this loop, unreliable AI output corrupts your system. With it, AI becomes a reliable tool you can depend on in production.

### Common Mistakes

**Using AI output without validation** crashes systems unpredictably. Always validate structured AI output—the minimal safety bar.

**Not providing format examples to AI** leads to preventable type mismatches. Show examples: "prep_time_minutes: 30 (integer, not string or '30 minutes')." Good examples reduce errors dramatically.

**Giving up after first failure** misses that iteration often succeeds. Design for 2-3 retry attempts with prompt refinement—most errors resolve quickly.

**Overcomplicating initial prompts** creates confusion. Start minimal. Let validation errors guide complexity—add detail only where needed.
