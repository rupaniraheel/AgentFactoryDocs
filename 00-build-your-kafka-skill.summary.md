### Core Concept
Create a Kafka skill before learning Kafka by using Claude to fetch official documentation and build the skill from authoritative sources rather than assumed knowledge.

### Key Mental Models
- Skill-First Learning: Own the skill before learning the technology
- Documentation-Grounded Skills: Skills built from official docs, not AI memory
- Progressive Skill Refinement: Learn the technology to improve your skill
- Fresh Start Pattern: Clone skills-lab to avoid state assumptions

### Critical Patterns
- Clone `claude-code-skills-lab` for fresh environment
- Use Context7 to fetch official Kafka documentation
- Single prompt skill creation with clarifying questions
- Skill appears at `.claude/skills/kafka-events/`

### AI Collaboration Keys
- Use skill creator skill with Context7 for documentation fetching
- Answer clarifying questions about topics, consumer groups, schema patterns
- Test and refine skill throughout the chapter

### Common Mistakes
- Building skills from AI memory instead of official documentation
- Assuming prior environment state exists
- Skipping the skill creation step and jumping to learning

### Connections
- **Builds on**: Previous chapter's skill-first learning pattern
- **Leads to**: Lesson 1 - From Request-Response to Events
