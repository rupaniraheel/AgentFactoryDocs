### Core Concept
Build a `gitops-deployment` skill grounded in official ArgoCD and GitHub Actions documentation before learning CI/CD patterns, enabling you to validate and improve the skill through hands-on exercises throughout the chapter.

### Key Mental Models
- **Skill-First Learning**: Build the skill before learning the content, then refine it as you progress through lessons
- **Documentation-Grounded Knowledge**: Skills based on official docs are more accurate than memory-based prompts
- **Iterative Improvement**: Each lesson tests and extends your skill with new patterns
- **Digital FTE Asset**: The skill becomes a sellable component of your agent portfolio

### Critical Patterns
- Clone skills-lab repository fresh before starting
- Write LEARNING-SPEC.md defining what you want to learn and success criteria
- Use /fetching-library-docs to ground skill in official documentation
- Use /skill-creator to generate the skill structure from docs

### AI Collaboration Keys
- Ask Claude to fetch ArgoCD and GitHub Actions official documentation
- Request skill creation with proper persona, logic, and data sections
- Have AI verify the skill against official patterns

### Common Mistakes
- Skipping the LEARNING-SPEC.md and jumping straight to skill creation
- Using AI memory instead of official documentation for skill content
- Not testing the skill before moving to subsequent lessons

### Connections
- **Builds on**: Chapter 51 Helm chart skills
- **Leads to**: Lesson 1 - CI/CD Concepts
