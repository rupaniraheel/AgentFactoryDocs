# Pod Security Standards: Hardening Container Workloads

In February 2022, security researchers demonstrated CVE-2022-0185—a container escape vulnerability affecting Linux kernels. An attacker with access to a container running as root could exploit a heap overflow in the filesystem context API to escape the container entirely and gain root access to the host node. A single compromised pod became a compromised cluster.

Container escapes exploit a fundamental problem: containers running with excessive privileges. Root users inside containers, mounted host filesystems, elevated Linux capabilities—each creates attack surface. Kubernetes Pod Security Standards (PSS) exist to eliminate these vectors systematically, enforcing security constraints before pods ever start.

Your Task API currently runs with default security settings. This lesson transforms it into a hardened workload that passes the most restrictive PSS profile.

---

## Understanding Pod Security Standards

**Pod Security Standards** define three progressively restrictive security profiles. Kubernetes enforces these profiles through the Pod Security Admission controller—a built-in admission controller enabled by default since Kubernetes 1.25.

### The Three PSS Levels

| Level | Purpose | Key Restrictions |
|-------|---------|------------------|
| **Privileged** | System workloads needing full access | None—pods can do anything |
| **Baseline** | Prevent known privilege escalations | Blocks hostNetwork, hostPID, hostIPC, privileged containers, hostPath mounts |
| **Restricted** | Maximum hardening for security-critical workloads | Baseline + runAsNonRoot, drop ALL capabilities, read-only root filesystem, seccomp profile required |

**When to use each level:**

- **Privileged**: CNI plugins, storage drivers, node agents—system components that genuinely need host access
- **Baseline**: Development environments, internal tools, workloads where Restricted would break functionality
- **Restricted**: Production APIs, customer-facing services, anything processing sensitive data

Your Task API belongs in the **Restricted** profile. It processes user requests, stores data, and has no legitimate need for host access or elevated privileges.

---

## Enforcement Modes

PSS namespace labels support three enforcement modes, allowing gradual rollout:

| Mode | Behavior | Use Case |
|------|----------|----------|
| **enforce** | Reject non-compliant pods | Production namespaces—violations blocked |
| **audit** | Allow pods but log violations | Visibility into compliance gaps before enforcement |
| **warn** | Allow pods but return warnings to client | Developer feedback during kubectl apply |

**Best practice**: Apply all three modes simultaneously. This provides immediate enforcement while also generating warnings and audit logs for operational visibility.

---

## Labeling Namespaces for PSS Enforcement

The Task API namespace needs Restricted profile enforcement. Apply labels using kubectl:

```bash
kubectl label namespace task-api \
  pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce=restricted \
  pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce-version=latest \
  pod-security.kubernetes.io/audit=restricted \
  pod-security.kubernetes.io/audit-version=latest \
  pod-security.kubernetes.io/warn=restricted \
  pod-security.kubernetes.io/warn-version=latest
```

**Output:**

```
namespace/task-api labeled
```

Verify the labels are applied:

```bash
kubectl get namespace task-api -o yaml | grep pod-security
```

**Output:**

```yaml
    pod-security.kubernetes.io/audit: restricted
    pod-security.kubernetes.io/audit-version: latest
    pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce: restricted
    pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce-version: latest
    pod-security.kubernetes.io/warn: restricted
    pod-security.kubernetes.io/warn-version: latest
```

**What these labels mean:**

- `enforce=restricted`: Pods violating Restricted profile are rejected
- `audit=restricted`: Violations logged to Kubernetes audit log
- `warn=restricted`: Users see warnings during `kubectl apply`
- `version=latest`: Use current Kubernetes version's Restricted definition

---

## Testing Enforcement: Privileged Pod Rejection

With enforcement active, attempt to deploy a privileged container. Create `test-privileged.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: test-privileged
  namespace: task-api
spec:
  containers:
  - name: test
    image: nginx:latest
    securityContext:
      privileged: true
```

```bash
kubectl apply -f test-privileged.yaml
```

**Output:**

```
Error from server (Forbidden): error when creating "test-privileged.yaml": pods "test-privileged" is forbidden: violates PodSecurity "restricted:latest": privileged (container "test" must not set securityContext.privileged=true)
```

The admission controller rejected the pod before it could be created. This is PSS working correctly.

---

## Writing a Restricted-Compliant Pod Spec

The Restricted profile requires specific securityContext fields. Here is a compliant Task API deployment. Create `task-api-deployment.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: task-api
  namespace: task-api
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: task-api
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: task-api
    spec:
      serviceAccountName: task-api-sa
      automountServiceAccountToken: false

      # Pod-level security context
      securityContext:
        runAsNonRoot: true
        runAsUser: 1000
        runAsGroup: 1000
        fsGroup: 1000
        seccompProfile:
          type: RuntimeDefault

      containers:
      - name: task-api
        image: ghcr.io/org/task-api:v1.0.0
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8000

        # Container-level security context
        securityContext:
          allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
          readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
          capabilities:
            drop:
              - ALL

        # Resource limits (good practice)
        resources:
          limits:
            memory: "256Mi"
            cpu: "500m"
          requests:
            memory: "128Mi"
            cpu: "100m"

        # Writable directory for application needs
        volumeMounts:
        - name: tmp
          mountPath: /tmp

      volumes:
      - name: tmp
        emptyDir: {}
```

**Output:**

```bash
kubectl apply -f task-api-deployment.yaml
```

```
deployment.apps/task-api created
```

Verify pods are running:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n task-api -l app=task-api
```

**Output:**

```
NAME                        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
task-api-6f9d8c7b5-abc12    1/1     Running   0          30s
task-api-6f9d8c7b5-def34    1/1     Running   0          30s
```

## Restricted Profile Requirements Explained

Each securityContext field addresses a specific attack vector:

| Field | Requirement | Attack Vector Mitigated |
|-------|-------------|------------------------|
| `runAsNonRoot: true` | Container cannot run as root user | Root-to-host escape exploits like CVE-2022-0185 |
| `runAsUser: 1000` | Explicit non-root UID | Prevents container defaulting to root |
| `allowPrivilegeEscalation: false` | Cannot gain privileges via setuid/setgid | Privilege escalation through binaries |
| `readOnlyRootFilesystem: true` | Container filesystem is immutable | Malware installation, config tampering |
| `capabilities.drop: ["ALL"]` | Remove all Linux capabilities | Capability-based attacks (CAP_SYS_ADMIN, CAP_NET_RAW) |
| `seccompProfile.type: RuntimeDefault` | System call filtering | Syscall-based container escapes |

**Why the /tmp volume mount?**

With `readOnlyRootFilesystem: true`, your application cannot write anywhere in the container filesystem. Many applications need a writable directory for temporary files, caches, or logs. The `emptyDir` volume provides a writable `/tmp` that:

- Is isolated to the pod (not shared with host)
- Is deleted when the pod terminates
- Does not compromise the security benefit of read-only root

---

## Common PSS Violations and Fixes

When migrating existing workloads to Restricted profile, you will encounter these violations:

| Violation Message | Cause | Fix |
|-------------------|-------|-----|
| `runAsNonRoot != true` | Missing or false runAsNonRoot | Add `securityContext.runAsNonRoot: true` and specify `runAsUser` |
| `allowPrivilegeEscalation != false` | Missing allowPrivilegeEscalation | Add `securityContext.allowPrivilegeEscalation: false` |
| `unrestricted capabilities` | Capabilities not dropped | Add `capabilities.drop: ["ALL"]` |
| `seccompProfile` | Missing seccomp profile | Add `securityContext.seccompProfile.type: RuntimeDefault` |
| `privileged` | Running as privileged container | Remove `privileged: true` (or use Privileged namespace) |
| `hostPath volumes` | Mounting host filesystem | Remove hostPath volumes (or use Privileged namespace) |

### Example: Fixing a Non-Compliant Deployment

Given this failing deployment:

```yaml
# FAILS: Missing security context
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: legacy-app
  namespace: task-api
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: app
        image: myapp:latest
```

The fix requires adding complete security context:

```yaml
# PASSES: Complete security context
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: legacy-app
  namespace: task-api
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      securityContext:
        runAsNonRoot: true
        runAsUser: 1000
        runAsGroup: 1000
        fsGroup: 1000
        seccompProfile:
          type: RuntimeDefault
      containers:
      - name: app
        image: myapp:latest
        securityContext:
          allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
          readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
          capabilities:
            drop:
              - ALL
        volumeMounts:
        - name: tmp
          mountPath: /tmp
      volumes:
      - name: tmp
        emptyDir: {}
```

---

## Verifying PSS Compliance

Use dry-run mode to test compliance without creating resources:

```bash
kubectl apply -f task-api-deployment.yaml --dry-run=server
```

**Output (compliant):**

```
deployment.apps/task-api created (server dry run)
```

**Output (non-compliant):**

```
Error from server (Forbidden): error when creating "task-api-deployment.yaml": pods "task-api" is forbidden: violates PodSecurity "restricted:latest": runAsNonRoot != true (container "task-api" must not set securityContext.runAsNonRoot=false)
```

The `--dry-run=server` flag sends the request through admission control but does not persist the resource. This validates PSS compliance before deployment.

---

## PSS in Multi-Environment Deployments

Different environments warrant different PSS levels:

| Environment | Recommended PSS Level | Rationale |
|-------------|----------------------|-----------|
| Development | Baseline | Faster iteration, debugging tools may need access |
| Staging | Restricted | Catches compliance issues before production |
| Production | Restricted | Maximum protection for customer data |

Create namespace with appropriate labels during provisioning:

```bash
# Production namespace
kubectl create namespace production-api
kubectl label namespace production-api \
  pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce=restricted \
  pod-security.kubernetes.io/warn=restricted \
  pod-security.kubernetes.io/audit=restricted

# Development namespace
kubectl create namespace dev-api
kubectl label namespace dev-api \
  pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce=baseline \
  pod-security.kubernetes.io/warn=restricted \
  pod-security.kubernetes.io/audit=restricted
```

Notice the development namespace uses `enforce=baseline` but `warn=restricted`. Developers see Restricted violations as warnings, preparing them for production constraints without blocking their work.

## Reflect on Your Skill

Test your `cloud-security` skill against what you learned:

```
Using my cloud-security skill, create a PSS-compliant Kubernetes
Deployment for a Python Flask API that:
- Runs on port 5000
- Needs to write logs to /var/log/app
- Uses the python:3.11-slim image
- Must pass Restricted PSS validation
```

**Evaluation questions:**

1. Does your skill include complete pod-level securityContext (runAsNonRoot, seccompProfile)?
2. Does your skill include container-level securityContext (allowPrivilegeEscalation, capabilities, readOnlyRootFilesystem)?
3. Does your skill handle the writable directory requirement correctly (emptyDir for /var/log/app)?
4. Does your skill set appropriate runAsUser/runAsGroup values?

If any answers are "no," update your skill with the patterns from this lesson.

## Try With AI

Test your understanding of Pod Security Standards and secure container configuration.

**Prompt 1:**

```
Review this securityContext and identify all PSS Restricted violations:

securityContext:
  runAsUser: 0
  allowPrivilegeEscalation: true
  capabilities:
    add:
      - NET_ADMIN
```

**What you're learning:** How to audit existing configurations for PSS compliance. The violations include: runAsUser: 0 (root), allowPrivilegeEscalation: true (must be false), and adding capabilities instead of dropping ALL. Practice identifying each violation before the fix.

**Prompt 2:**

```
My Deployment keeps failing with "violates PodSecurity restricted" but
I've set runAsNonRoot: true. The image is nginx:latest and the error
says "container has runAsNonRoot and image will run as root". What's
happening and how do I fix it?
```

**What you're learning:** The difference between Kubernetes configuration and container image defaults. The nginx:latest image runs as root by default—setting runAsNonRoot: true tells Kubernetes to reject containers that would run as root, but doesn't change the image. The fix requires either using an nginx image built for non-root (nginx:1.25-alpine with explicit USER) or specifying runAsUser that overrides the image default.

**Prompt 3:**

```
Design a PSS enforcement strategy for a company with these requirements:
- Developers can run any container locally in their dev namespaces
- Pre-production must catch Restricted violations before deployment
- Production namespaces cannot run any non-compliant workloads

What namespace labels would you apply to each environment?
```

**What you're learning:** How to design a progressive enforcement strategy across environments. The pattern uses Privileged for dev (maximum flexibility), Restricted with warn for pre-prod (visibility without blocking), and Restricted with enforce for production (zero tolerance).

:::warning Security Reminder
Pod Security Standards are admission-time controls—they prevent non-compliant pods from being created but do not affect already-running pods. After enabling PSS on a namespace, existing non-compliant pods continue running until they are deleted or restarted. Use `kubectl rollout restart` to force re-evaluation of existing deployments against PSS policies.
