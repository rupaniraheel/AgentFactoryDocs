# CI/CD Concepts: The Automated Pipeline

You've been managing deployments manually: commit code, build a container, test locally, push to registry, run kubectl commands. This works for one person learning Kubernetes. At scale, manual deployments become a bottleneck. A single typo in a deployment command can take down production. Without automated testing, bugs make it to users. Without audit trails, nobody knows who deployed what, when, or why.

CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) solves this by automating the entire path from code commit to running service. Every change automatically triggers a pipeline: tests validate quality, builds produce artifacts, registries store versions, and deployments propagate to clusters. The pipeline becomes your quality guarantee.

This lesson teaches the conceptual foundations of CI/CD pipelines—the stages, the flow, the artifacts, and why each stage matters. You'll understand pipeline design before GitHub Actions syntax, and deployment principles before ArgoCD configuration.

## The Five Stages of a CI/CD Pipeline

Every production pipeline has the same conceptual structure, regardless of tools. Think of it like assembly line manufacturing:

```
Code Push → Build → Test → Push → Deploy
   ↓        ↓       ↓       ↓       ↓
 Trigger  Compile Execute Publish Execute
```

Let's walk through each stage:

### Stage 1: Trigger (Someone Pushed Code)

**What happens**: A developer commits to main branch. A webhook fires. The pipeline wakes up.

**Why this matters**: The trigger determines when automation starts. Without it, deployments stay manual. Common triggers:

- **Push to main**: "Deploy on every commit" (high-cadence teams)
- **Pull request opened**: "Run tests before merge" (safety gate)
- **Tag created**: "Deploy only on release tags" (careful, controlled)
- **Manual dispatch**: "Allow human to start pipeline" (on-demand, special cases)

**Example trigger context**: Your FastAPI agent lives in `panaversity-agents/agent-task-service` on GitHub. When you push to `main`, GitHub Actions receives a webhook event. The pipeline is triggered.

**Artifact at this stage**: A Git event (commit hash, branch name, author).

### Stage 2: Build (Compile and Package)

**What happens**: The pipeline checks out your code, compiles/packages it, produces a deliverable. For Python projects, this might be a wheel file or Docker image.

**Why this matters**: Compilation catches syntax errors early. Packaging ensures deployments are consistent (same code, same dependencies).

**Example build context**: Your FastAPI agent Dockerfile has dependencies pinned:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY pyproject.toml poetry.lock ./
RUN pip install poetry && poetry install --no-root
COPY . .
RUN poetry install
CMD ["uvicorn", "app.main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
```

**Output:**
```
Successfully built image: agent-task-service:abc123def456
```

The build stage produces a **container image artifact**—a complete, self-contained package that runs anywhere (local machine, CI runner, Kubernetes cluster).

**Artifact at this stage**: A container image (or compiled binary, or wheel file—the thing to deploy).

### Stage 3: Test (Validate Quality)

**What happens**: The pipeline runs automated tests. Unit tests validate individual functions. Integration tests validate components work together. The pipeline only proceeds if tests pass.

**Why this matters**: Manual testing is unreliable (testers get tired, forget cases). Automated tests catch regressions before they reach users.

**Example test context**: Your FastAPI agent has tests:

```python
def test_task_creation():
    """Task creation endpoint returns 201 with created task"""
    response = client.post("/tasks", json={"title": "Fix auth bug", "priority": "high"})
    assert response.status_code == 201
    assert response.json()["id"] is not None

def test_invalid_priority():
    """Invalid priority is rejected"""
    response = client.post("/tasks", json={"title": "Test", "priority": "maybe"})
    assert response.status_code == 400
```

**Output:**
```
tests/test_tasks.py::test_task_creation PASSED
tests/test_tasks.py::test_invalid_priority PASSED
============ 2 passed in 0.45s ============
```

If ANY test fails, the pipeline **stops here**. No deployment proceeds with broken code. This is the **quality gate**—the automated checkpoint that prevents bad code from reaching production.

**Artifact at this stage**: Test results and coverage reports (proof that code works as expected).

### Stage 4: Push (Publish the Artifact)

**What happens**: The tested, built artifact is published to a registry where it can be deployed from. For container images, this means pushing to Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry (GHCR), or similar.

**Why this matters**: Registries are the source of truth for deployments. They version artifacts, store metadata, and make images available to clusters worldwide.

**Example push context**: After tests pass, the pipeline tags the image with the commit hash and version:

```bash
docker tag agent-task-service:latest ghcr.io/panaversity/agent-task-service:1.0.0
docker tag agent-task-service:latest ghcr.io/panaversity/agent-task-service:sha-abc123def456
docker push ghcr.io/panaversity/agent-task-service:1.0.0
docker push ghcr.io/panaversity/agent-task-service:sha-abc123def456
```

**Output:**
```
Pushed: ghcr.io/panaversity/agent-task-service:1.0.0
Pushed: ghcr.io/panaversity/agent-task-service:sha-abc123def456
```

Now any cluster with registry access can pull and run that image.

**Artifact at this stage**: Published artifact in a registry (versioned, immutable copy).

### Stage 5: Deploy (Run in Production)

**What happens**: The pipeline instructs Kubernetes (or another orchestration system) to pull the image and run it. In GitOps (which you'll see in later lessons), this means committing a configuration file to Git, and a GitOps controller automatically reconciles the cluster to match.

**Why this matters**: Deployment automation ensures consistency across environments (dev, staging, production all follow the same process). With versioning, you can rollback to previous versions if something breaks.

**Example deploy context**: A Kubernetes Deployment manifest specifies which image to run:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: agent-task-service
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: agent-task-service
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: agent-task-service
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: agent
        image: ghcr.io/panaversity/agent-task-service:1.0.0
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8000
        livenessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /health
            port: 8000
          initialDelaySeconds: 10
```

**Output:**
```
deployment.apps/agent-task-service created
service/agent-task-service created
3/3 pods running
```

The service is live, handling requests.

**Artifact at this stage**: A running service in production (validated, versioned, auditable).

## Continuous Integration vs Continuous Deployment

CI and CD are separate concepts, often confused:

### Continuous Integration (CI)

**Definition**: Automatically integrate code changes into a shared repository, run tests, and report results.

**Where it happens**: Stages 1-3 (Trigger, Build, Test).

**Purpose**: Catch integration problems early. If your code works alone but breaks when combined with teammate's changes, CI detects it immediately.

**What "continuous" means**: Every commit runs the pipeline, not weekly integration sessions.

**Example CI flow**:
```
Your PR is pushed
    ↓
Tests run automatically
    ↓
Results appear on PR within 2 minutes
    ↓
If tests pass → "Ready to merge"
If tests fail → "Fix these issues before merging"
```

### Continuous Deployment (CD)

**Definition**: Automatically deploy validated code to production after successful tests.

**Where it happens**: Stages 4-5 (Push, Deploy).

**Purpose**: Get working code to users immediately, without waiting for manual deployment windows.

**What "continuous" means**: Every merge to main deploys to production (in high-trust teams). More conservative teams deploy manually but use CD infrastructure (push a button instead of running commands).

**Example CD flow**:
```
Tests pass on main
    ↓
Image published to registry
    ↓
Deployment manifest updated
    ↓
Kubernetes sees new image
    ↓
Pods restart with new code
    ↓
Service updated (users see new version)
```

### CI vs CD: The Distinction

| Aspect | CI | CD |
|--------|----|----|
| **Stages** | Trigger, Build, Test | Push, Deploy |
| **Focus** | "Does this code work?" | "Is this code in production?" |
| **Frequency** | Per commit | Per successful CI |
| **Risk** | Low (nothing deployed yet) | Higher (affects users) |
| **Reversal** | Delete commit (rare) | Rollback to previous version (common) |

**In practice**: CI is automatic (tests always run). CD can be automatic (deploy immediately) or gated (require manual approval before deploying).

## Artifacts and Their Lifecycle

A CI/CD pipeline produces and consumes **artifacts**—concrete outputs that move through stages.

### What Is an Artifact?

An artifact is anything produced during the pipeline that becomes input for the next stage:

- **Code** (Git commit): Source at pipeline start
- **Compiled output** (Docker image): Built by Build stage
- **Test reports** (JSON files): Produced by Test stage
- **Published image** (in registry): Output of Push stage
- **Running service** (in Kubernetes): Result of Deploy stage

### The Artifact Lifecycle

```
Source Code (Git)
    ↓ [Build stage reads]
Docker Image (local)
    ↓ [Test stage uses]
Test Results (reports)
    ↓ [Push stage reads]
Published Image (registry)
    ↓ [Deploy stage pulls]
Running Pods (cluster)
```

Each stage reads artifacts from the previous stage and produces new artifacts.

### Versioning Artifacts

Proper versioning prevents confusion: "Which code is running in production?"

**Example**: Your FastAPI agent on commit `abc123`:

- **Commit hash**: `abc123def456789...` (unique, 40-char identifier)
- **Short hash**: `abc123` (first 7 chars, human-readable)
- **Semantic version**: `1.2.3` (meaningful to users: major.minor.patch)
- **Registry tags**: All of the above

```bash
# Three ways to refer to the same image
docker pull ghcr.io/panaversity/agent-task-service:abc123
docker pull ghcr.io/panaversity/agent-task-service:1.2.3
docker pull ghcr.io/panaversity/agent-task-service:latest  # Points to 1.2.3
```

**Traceability**: From any running pod, you can ask "What commit is this?" The image tag tells you.

## Quality Gates: Blocking Failures Before Production

A **quality gate** is a decision point in the pipeline: "Is this artifact good enough to proceed?"

### Why Quality Gates Matter

Without gates, broken code reaches production:

**Without gates**: Commit → Build → (no test) → Push → Deploy → 🔥 Service down

**With gates**: Commit → Build → Test fails → Pipeline stops → Bug fixed → Retry

### The Test Quality Gate

The most common gate is **test execution**. When tests fail, the pipeline stops:

```
tests/test_auth.py::test_invalid_token FAILED
AssertionError: Expected 401, got 200

Pipeline Status: FAILED ❌
Next stages blocked until this is fixed
```

No deployment proceeds with broken code.

### Other Quality Gates

Beyond tests, pipelines can have:

- **Code quality gates**: SonarQube checks code complexity, duplication
- **Security gates**: SAST (static application security testing) scans for vulnerabilities
- **Coverage gates**: "Tests must cover 80% of code"
- **Performance gates**: "This change can't make the app 10% slower"
- **Manual approval gates**: "Require human review before deploying"

Each gate is a `pass/fail` checkpoint. Fail any gate, and the pipeline stops.

## Why Automation Matters: Five Benefits

### 1. Speed

Manual deployments take hours (build locally, test locally, coordinate with ops team, run deployment commands). Automated pipelines complete in minutes.

**Example**: Your agent changes take 30 minutes to deploy manually. Automated: 5 minutes from commit to running.

### 2. Consistency

Humans forget steps. Ops runs deployment differently on Mondays than Thursdays. Automated pipelines run identically every time.

**Example**: Build always installs dependencies the same way. Deploy always waits for health checks. No variation, no surprises.

### 3. Auditability

Every deployment is logged: who committed, what changed, tests results, deployment time, version deployed. This is essential for compliance (healthcare, finance, security).

**Example**: Audit log shows: "User alice deployed version 1.2.3 at 2025-12-23 10:42 UTC. All tests passed. Service health: green."

### 4. Rollback Capability

With versioned artifacts, rolling back is simple: point to the previous version.

**Example**: Version 1.2.4 has a bug. Rollback to 1.2.3 in seconds instead of hours of manual recovery.

### 5. Safety Through Automation

The pipeline catches errors before humans make them. Syntax errors, test failures, security vulnerabilities—all caught automatically.

**Example**: A developer accidentally commits database credentials. CI security scanning detects this and blocks the commit before it reaches the registry.

## The Value Proposition

**Manual deployments**: Slow, error-prone, hard to audit, hard to rollback.

**CI/CD pipelines**: Fast, reliable, auditable, reversible.

This is why every production system has CI/CD. It's not optional at scale—it's how you reliably ship code.

## Try With AI

Ask Claude: "I have a Python FastAPI application with unit tests stored in a GitHub repository. What would a CI/CD pipeline look like for this project? Walk me through the stages—what happens at each one?"

As Claude responds, evaluate:

- Did it identify all five stages (Trigger, Build, Test, Push, Deploy)?
- Did it explain why each stage matters?
- Did it suggest concrete tools (GitHub Actions for CI, Docker for images, registry for push)?
- For your own project, what would you add to this pipeline? Security scanning? Performance tests? Code coverage requirements?

Spend 10 minutes sketching out your ideal pipeline for your own project:

1. **Trigger**: When should the pipeline start? (Every commit? Every tag? Manual?)
2. **Build**: What artifact should be produced? (Container image? Compiled binary?)
3. **Test**: What quality gates matter? (Unit tests? Integration tests? Security scans?)
4. **Push**: Where should artifacts be published? (Docker Hub? GHCR? Private registry?)
5. **Deploy**: Where should code run? (Kubernetes? App Engine? Lambda?)

This is the foundation. Later lessons show how to implement these stages with GitHub Actions and ArgoCD.
