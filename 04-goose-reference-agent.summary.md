### Core Concept
goose is Block's open source AI agent—a production-tested reference implementation proving MCP and AGENTS.md work at enterprise scale, with 75% of Block engineers saving 8-10+ hours every week.

### Key Mental Models
- **Reference Implementation**: goose shows what a working MCP-native agent looks like in production
- **Blueprint for Custom Agents**: Study goose's architecture when building your own Digital FTEs
- **General Agent (Path A)**: Like Claude Code, goose is ready-to-use—not a framework for building custom agents

### Critical Patterns
- Local-first execution: privacy, control, speed (required for enterprise clients)
- MCP-native: connect any MCP server to add capabilities
- LLM-agnostic: Claude, GPT, Gemini, or local models—avoid vendor lock-in
- Apache 2.0 license: study source code to learn agent internals
- AAIF founding project: contributed to neutral Linux Foundation governance

### Common Mistakes
- Thinking goose and Claude Code compete—they validate the same standards
- Assuming open source means less capable—goose runs at Block enterprise scale
- Ignoring goose's architecture when designing your own Custom Agents

### Connections
- **Builds on**: MCP (Lesson 2), AGENTS.md (Lesson 3)
- **Leads to**: Agent Skills for packaging expertise (Lesson 5)
