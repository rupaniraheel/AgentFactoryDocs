# Provisioning DOKS Cluster

You have a DigitalOcean account and doctl authenticated. Now comes the moment you've been working toward: creating your first production Kubernetes cluster in the cloud.

This isn't Docker Desktop running locally. This is real cloud infrastructure—virtual machines in a DigitalOcean data center, managed Kubernetes control plane, and a Load Balancer endpoint accessible from anywhere on the internet.

The command takes 5-10 minutes to complete. By the end of this lesson, `kubectl get nodes` will show nodes running in a real data center, not your laptop.

---

## The Cluster Provisioning Decision

Before running the command, you need to decide three things:

| Decision | Question | Task API Answer |
|----------|----------|-----------------|
| **Node Size** | How much CPU/RAM per node? | s-2vcpu-4gb (2 vCPUs, 4GB RAM) |
| **Node Count** | How many worker nodes? | 3 nodes (for availability) |
| **Region** | Which data center? | nyc1 (or closest to you) |

### Why s-2vcpu-4gb?

The Task API is a FastAPI application with Dapr sidecar. It doesn't need massive resources:

| Node Size | vCPUs | RAM | Monthly Cost | Fit for Task API |
|-----------|-------|-----|--------------|------------------|
| s-1vcpu-2gb | 1 | 2GB | ~$12/node | Too small (Dapr needs headroom) |
| **s-2vcpu-4gb** | 2 | 4GB | ~$24/node | **Right size** |
| s-4vcpu-8gb | 4 | 8GB | ~$48/node | Oversized (wasted money) |

**The principle**: Start with the smallest size that works, scale up when metrics prove you need it.

### Why 3 Nodes?

Kubernetes distributes workloads across nodes. With 3 nodes:

- **High availability**: If one node fails, two remain healthy
- **Rolling updates**: Pods migrate during updates without downtime
- **Resource headroom**: Pods aren't fighting for space during deployments

**Minimum viable cluster**: 2 nodes works but leaves no margin. 3 is the production starting point.

### Why Region nyc1?

Choose the region closest to your users. DigitalOcean regions:

| Region | Location | Use When |
|--------|----------|----------|
| nyc1, nyc3 | New York | US East Coast users |
| sfo1, sfo2 | San Francisco | US West Coast users |
| ams3 | Amsterdam | European users |
| sgp1 | Singapore | Asian users |
| blr1 | Bangalore | Indian users |

For learning, any region works. For production, proximity reduces latency.

## Provision the Cluster

Run this command to create your DOKS cluster:

```bash
doctl kubernetes cluster create task-api-cluster \
  --region nyc1 \
  --version 1.31.4-do.0 \
  --size s-2vcpu-4gb \
  --count 3 \
  --wait
```

**Output**:
```
Notice: Cluster is provisioning, waiting for cluster to be running
..........
Notice: Cluster created, fetching credentials
Notice: Adding cluster credentials to kubeconfig file
Notice: Setting current-context to do-nyc1-task-api-cluster

ID                                      Name                 Region    Version        Auto Upgrade    Status     Node Pools
12345678-abcd-1234-abcd-123456789012    task-api-cluster     nyc1      1.31.4-do.0    false           running    default-pool
```

This takes 5-10 minutes. The `--wait` flag blocks until the cluster is fully running.

### What Each Option Does

| Option | Value | Effect |
|--------|-------|--------|
| `--region` | nyc1 | Creates cluster in New York data center |
| `--version` | 1.31.4-do.0 | Kubernetes version (latest stable at time of writing) |
| `--size` | s-2vcpu-4gb | Each worker node gets 2 vCPUs and 4GB RAM |
| `--count` | 3 | Creates 3 worker nodes in the default node pool |
| `--wait` | (flag) | Blocks until cluster is fully running |

### Finding Available Options

**List available Kubernetes versions**:

```bash
doctl kubernetes options versions
```

**Output**:
```
Slug              Kubernetes Version    Supported Features
1.31.4-do.0       1.31.4               cluster-autoscaler, docr-integration
1.30.8-do.0       1.30.8               cluster-autoscaler, docr-integration
1.29.12-do.0      1.29.12              cluster-autoscaler, docr-integration
```

**List available node sizes**:

```bash
doctl kubernetes options sizes
```

**Output**:
```
Slug               Name
s-1vcpu-2gb        s-1vcpu-2gb
s-2vcpu-2gb        s-2vcpu-2gb
s-2vcpu-4gb        s-2vcpu-4gb
s-4vcpu-8gb        s-4vcpu-8gb
...
```

**List available regions for Kubernetes**:

```bash
doctl kubernetes options regions
```

**Output**:
```
Slug    Name
nyc1    New York 1
nyc3    New York 3
sfo2    San Francisco 2
sfo3    San Francisco 3
ams3    Amsterdam 3
sgp1    Singapore 1
blr1    Bangalore 1
...
```

## Verify Your Cluster

After provisioning completes, verify the cluster is healthy.

### Check Nodes

```bash
kubectl get nodes
```

**Output**:
```
NAME                         STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION
task-api-cluster-default-1   Ready    <none>   5m    v1.31.4
task-api-cluster-default-2   Ready    <none>   5m    v1.31.4
task-api-cluster-default-3   Ready    <none>   5m    v1.31.4
```

You now have 3 worker nodes running in DigitalOcean's data center. These are real virtual machines.

### Check System Pods

```bash
kubectl get pods -n kube-system
```

**Output**:
```
NAME                                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
cilium-operator-5d4b8c9c79-2xjkl          1/1     Running   0          5m

kube-proxy-vxyz1                          1/1     Running   0          5m
```

**Key components**:
- **cilium**: Network plugin (DigitalOcean's choice for DOKS)
- **coredns**: DNS for service discovery
- **csi-do-node**: Storage driver for DigitalOcean volumes
- **do-node-agent**: DigitalOcean monitoring agent
- **kube-proxy**: Network rules for Services

All pods should be `Running` with no restarts.

### Check Cluster Info

```bash
kubectl cluster-info
```

**Output**:
```
Kubernetes control plane is running at https://12345678-abcd-1234-abcd-123456789012.k8s.ondigitalocean.com
CoreDNS is running at https://12345678-abcd-1234-abcd-123456789012.k8s.ondigitalocean.com/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns:dns/proxy
```

The control plane URL shows this is a managed DOKS cluster—DigitalOcean handles control plane availability.

## Understanding kubeconfig and Context

When doctl created the cluster, it automatically:

1. Downloaded credentials to `~/.kube/config`
2. Set the current context to your DOKS cluster

### View Your Contexts

```bash
kubectl config get-contexts
```

**Output**:
```
CURRENT   NAME                          CLUSTER                       AUTHINFO                            NAMESPACE
          docker-desktop                docker-desktop                docker-desktop
*         do-nyc1-task-api-cluster      do-nyc1-task-api-cluster      do-nyc1-task-api-cluster
```

The `*` marks your current context. You're now connected to DOKS, not Docker Desktop.

### Switch Between Contexts

To switch back to Docker Desktop for local testing:

```bash
kubectl config use-context docker-desktop
```

**Output**:
```
Switched to context "docker-desktop".
```

To switch back to DOKS:

```bash
kubectl config use-context do-nyc1-task-api-cluster
```

**Output**:
```
Switched to context "do-nyc1-task-api-cluster".
```

### Manually Save kubeconfig (If Needed)

If you need to reconfigure kubectl credentials (new machine, expired tokens):

```bash
doctl kubernetes cluster kubeconfig save task-api-cluster
```

**Output**:
```
Notice: Adding cluster credentials to kubeconfig file found in "/Users/yourname/.kube/config"
Notice: Setting current-context to do-nyc1-task-api-cluster
```

This regenerates tokens and updates your local kubeconfig.

---

## Cost Awareness

Your cluster is now costing money. Know what you're paying:

| Resource | Monthly Cost |
|----------|--------------|
| 3x s-2vcpu-4gb nodes | ~$72/month ($24 each) |
| Load Balancer (created in L04) | ~$12/month |
| **Total minimum** | **~$84/month** |

### Set Up Budget Alerts

Go to [cloud.digitalocean.com/account/billing](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/account/billing) and set:
- **Alert threshold**: $100/month (warns before you hit limit)
- **Email notifications**: Enabled

### Teardown When Not Using

If you're done learning for the day, delete the cluster:

```bash
doctl kubernetes cluster delete task-api-cluster --force
```

You can reprovision in 5-10 minutes. Don't pay for idle clusters.

---

## Common Issues

### "Error: unable to find a default cluster"

Your context isn't set correctly. Run:

```bash
doctl kubernetes cluster kubeconfig save task-api-cluster
```

### "Error: could not authenticate"

Your DigitalOcean token expired or doctl isn't authenticated. Re-authenticate:

```bash
doctl auth init
```

### Cluster Creation Takes Longer Than 10 Minutes

Sometimes node provisioning is slow. Check status in DigitalOcean dashboard or run:

```bash
doctl kubernetes cluster get task-api-cluster
```

If status is `provisioning`, wait. If status is `error`, delete and retry.

### "Error: not enough resources"

DigitalOcean may have capacity constraints in a region. Try:
- Different region (`--region sfo2`)
- Smaller node size (`--size s-1vcpu-2gb`)
- Fewer nodes (`--count 2`)

---

## What You've Accomplished

You now have:

- A production Kubernetes cluster running in DigitalOcean's data center
- 3 worker nodes with 2 vCPUs and 4GB RAM each
- kubectl configured to communicate with DOKS
- Understanding of node sizing, count, and region selection
- Context switching between local and cloud clusters

This is real cloud infrastructure. The kubectl commands you learned in Chapter 50 work identically here. The difference: these nodes are in a data center, not your laptop.

Next lesson, you'll configure the cloud Load Balancer and DNS—making your cluster accessible from the internet.

---

## Try With AI

Explore your DOKS cluster with AI assistance.

### Prompt 1: Node Pool Configuration

```
I just provisioned a DOKS cluster with 3 nodes using s-2vcpu-4gb size.

Looking at 'doctl kubernetes cluster node-pool list task-api-cluster',
I see a 'default-pool'.

How do I:
1. Add a second node pool with larger nodes for memory-intensive workloads?
2. Use node selectors to schedule specific pods to specific pools?
3. Enable cluster autoscaling to add nodes during high load?
```

**What you're learning**: Node pool management for heterogeneous workloads—running different pod types on different node sizes.

### Prompt 2: Kubernetes Version Upgrades

```
My DOKS cluster is running Kubernetes 1.31.4-do.0.

DigitalOcean will release newer versions over time. Help me understand:
1. How do I check what versions are available for upgrade?
2. What's the process for upgrading a running cluster?
3. What are the risks and how do I minimize downtime?
```

**What you're learning**: Cluster lifecycle management—keeping Kubernetes current without disrupting running workloads.

### Prompt 3: Multi-Cluster Strategy

```
I now have both docker-desktop and do-nyc1-task-api-cluster contexts in kubectl.

For a real development workflow:
1. How do I avoid accidentally deploying to production?
2. What naming conventions help distinguish dev/staging/prod clusters?
3. Should I use tools like kubectx/kubens to manage contexts?
```

**What you're learning**: Safe multi-cluster workflows that prevent production incidents.

---

## Reflect on Your Skill

You built a `multi-cloud-deployer` skill in Lesson 0. Test and improve it based on what you learned.

### Test Your Skill

```
Using my multi-cloud-deployer skill, generate the doctl command
to provision a DOKS cluster in Amsterdam (ams3) with 2 nodes of 4 vCPUs each.
```

Does your skill produce the correct `doctl kubernetes cluster create` command with `--region ams3`, `--size s-4vcpu-8gb`, and `--count 2`?

### Identify Gaps

Ask yourself:
- Does my skill include kubeconfig save and context switching?
- Does it explain node size selection for different workloads?
- Does it cover the `--wait` flag and provisioning verification commands?

### Improve Your Skill

If you found gaps:

```
My multi-cloud-deployer skill is missing DOKS provisioning patterns.
Update it to include:
- doctl kubernetes cluster create with all common options
- doctl kubernetes cluster kubeconfig save for credential management
- kubectl config use-context for cluster switching
- Verification commands (kubectl get nodes, kubectl cluster-info)
- Cost awareness and teardown procedures
```
