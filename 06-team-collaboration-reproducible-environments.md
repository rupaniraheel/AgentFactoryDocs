# Team Collaboration and Reproducible Environments with AI

## The "Works on My Machine" Problem

You've created a fantastic Python project. Your code runs perfectly on your computer. You invite a teammate to work on it and... their environment doesn't match yours. They get errors. Dependencies are different versions. The Python version is different. Nothing works.

This is the **"works on my machine" problem**, and it's plagued software teams for decades.

The solution? **Reproducible environments** — using UV to ensure that every developer on your team has the exact same library versions, the exact same Python version, and the exact same environment setup. No surprises. No debugging environment differences.

This is the capstone lesson of the UV chapter: we're moving from individual development to team workflows.

## Understanding: What Makes Environments Reproducible?

### The Two Files Your Project Needs

Your UV project contains two critical files that work together:

**File 1: `pyproject.toml` (Constraints)**

This file says "what I want, roughly":

```toml
[project]
dependencies = [
    "requests>=2.31.0",
    "flask>=3.0",
]

[project.optional-dependencies]
dev = [
    "pytest>=7.0",
    "black>=23.0",
]
```

Notice the `>=` signs. This means "I want `requests`, version 2.31.0 or higher." It's flexible—if a newer version appears, that's fine.

**File 2: `uv.lock` (Pinned Versions)**

This file says "here's exactly what I have":

```
requests==2.32.1
flask==3.0.2
pytest==7.4.0
black==23.12.0
```

Notice the `==` signs. This means "I tested with this exact version." It's strict—everyone gets this exact version.


### Why Both Files?

Think of it like a recipe versus a specific meal:

- **pyproject.toml** = Recipe ("Use flour, roughly 2-3 cups")
- **uv.lock** = Exact meal ("2.5 cups of King Arthur flour, batch #2024-10")

When you're **developing alone**, `pyproject.toml` is flexible enough. You might use requests 2.31 or 2.32; both work fine.

But when you're **on a team**, you need the exact meal. If developer A used requests 2.31 and developer B used requests 2.32, and they have different behavior, you'll spend hours debugging an environment difference (not a code bug).

That's why UV **automatically creates and updates `uv.lock`** every time you run `uv add` or `uv sync`.


## Real-World Scenario 1: Preparing Your Project for a Teammate

You've built a web scraper with UV. Now you want your teammate Maria to work on it.

### Step 1: Ensure Both Files Exist

Verify your project has both `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock`. If `uv.lock` doesn't exist:

```bash
uv lock
```

### Step 2: Commit Both Files to Git

```bash
# These files go to Git:
git add pyproject.toml uv.lock .python-version

# These do NOT go to Git (already in .gitignore):
# .venv/           <- Virtual environment
# __pycache__/     <- Python cache
# *.pyc            <- Compiled bytecode
```

**Why not commit `.venv`?** It's 50+ MB of dependencies. Everyone can recreate it in seconds using `uv.lock`.

## Real-World Scenario 2: Teammate Clone and Setup

Maria just cloned your project. She has:

```
web-scraper/
├── pyproject.toml    # Constraints
├── uv.lock           # Exact versions
└── src/
    └── scraper.py    # Your code
```

She does **not** have `.venv/` yet—she'll create it.

### She Runs `uv sync`

```bash
uv sync
```

**Output:**
```
Resolved 15 packages in 0.25s
Downloaded 15 packages in 0.18s
Installed 15 packages in 0.08s
```

**What happened:**
1. UV read `uv.lock`
2. Downloaded exact versions (requests 2.32.1, beautifulsoup4 4.12.0, etc.)
3. Created `.venv/` with those exact packages

Maria's environment is now byte-for-byte identical to yours.

### She Runs Your Code

```bash
uv run python src/scraper.py
```

**Output:**
```
Scraping https://example.com...
Found 42 items
Saved to results.json
```

Perfect. No "works on my machine" problems.

---

## Real-World Scenario 3: Adding a New Dependency Mid-Project

Two weeks later, Maria needs `pandas` for data analysis.

### Maria Adds the Dependency

```bash
uv add pandas
```

**Output:**
```
Resolved 52 packages in 0.40s
Downloaded 52 packages in 0.31s
Installed 52 packages in 0.12s
```

UV updates both `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` with pandas and its 50+ dependencies.

### Maria Commits

```bash
git add pyproject.toml uv.lock
git commit -m "Add pandas for data analysis"
```

### You Pull and Sync

```bash
git pull
uv sync
```

Now you have pandas too, with the exact same version Maria has.

---

## Real-World Scenario 4: Production Deployment

When deploying to production, you don't need dev tools (pytest, black, etc.). Use:

```bash
uv sync --no-dev
```

This installs only production dependencies (`requests`, `beautifulsoup4`, `pandas`) and skips dev tools. Keeps your production environment lean, fast, and secure.

---

## Lockfile Updates: When and Why

### Scenario 1: Adding a New Dependency

When you run `uv add new-package`, UV **automatically updates `uv.lock`**:

```bash
uv add requests
# uv.lock is updated automatically
git add pyproject.toml uv.lock
git commit -m "Add requests"
```

### Scenario 2: Updating Existing Packages

After months, you want to update dependencies:

```bash
# Check what's available
uv pip compile --upgrade pyproject.toml

# Actually update (test thoroughly before committing!)
uv lock --upgrade
```

This re-resolves dependencies with latest versions (respecting constraints in `pyproject.toml`) and updates `uv.lock`.

---

## Onboarding a New Team Member

New developer Alex joins the team:

```bash
# Step 1: Clone
git clone https://github.com/yourorg/web-scraper.git
cd web-scraper

# Step 2: Sync (recreates exact environment)
uv sync

# Step 3: Verify
uv run pytest
```

In 30 seconds, Alex has your exact environment. If tests pass, they're ready to develop.

---

## Handling Lockfile Conflicts (Advanced)

**Scenario**: You added `package-a` on your branch. Maria added `package-b` on hers. Now `uv.lock` has a Git conflict.

**Fix:**
```bash
# Don't manually edit uv.lock. Instead:
git merge --abort  # Undo merge
git pull           # Get latest
uv lock            # Regenerate lockfile with all changes
git add uv.lock
git commit -m "Merge dependencies from both branches"
```

**Why:** `uv lock` re-resolves all dependencies and creates a consistent lockfile automatically. Never manually edit `uv.lock`.

---

## Git Integration: What to Commit, What to Ignore

Here's the complete picture of what goes to Git and what doesn't:

| File/Directory | Commit? | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `pyproject.toml` | ✅ **YES** | Project configuration; needed for dependency resolution |
| `uv.lock` | ✅ **YES** | Exact versions; needed for reproducibility |
| `.python-version` | ✅ **YES** | Python version specification; needed for consistency |
| `src/` | ✅ **YES** | Your code |
| `.venv/` | ❌ **NO** | Environment directory; 50+ MB, recreated by `uv sync` |
| `__pycache__/` | ❌ **NO** | Python cache; recreated when code runs |
| `*.pyc` | ❌ **NO** | Compiled bytecode; recreated automatically |
| `.env` | ❌ **NO** (with care) | Secrets; use `.env.example` instead |

UV creates `.gitignore` automatically when you run `uv init`, so most of this is handled for you.

## The Collaboration Workflow Summary

Here's the complete team workflow with UV:

```
Developer A (You):
1. Create project with uv init
2. Add dependencies with uv add
3. Code and test
4. Commit pyproject.toml + uv.lock to Git

Developer B (Teammate):
1. Clone repository (gets pyproject.toml + uv.lock)
2. Run uv sync (recreates exact environment)
3. Code and test in identical environment
4. Add new dependency with uv add
5. Commit updated pyproject.toml + uv.lock

Developer C (New Team Member):
1. Clone repository
2. Run uv sync (3-second setup)
3. Run uv run pytest (verify everything works)
4. Start developing
```

No environment mismatches. No "works on my machine" problems. Every developer, every branch, every deployment—identical environment.

## Try With AI

Why do we need both `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock`, and how do teams stay synchronized?

**🔍 Explore Lockfile Differences:**
> "I added requests to my UV project. Now `pyproject.toml` shows `requests>=2.31.0` but `uv.lock` shows `requests==2.32.1`. Why does pyproject.toml use >= while uv.lock uses ==? What happens if my teammate clones the project without the lockfile? Which files should Git track and why?"

**🧪 Test Team Conflict Scenarios:**
> "My team hit these problems: Scenario A - I added pandas on my branch, teammate added numpy on theirs, we merged and now uv.lock has Git conflicts. Scenario B - Maria has requests 2.31.0, I have 2.32.1, we need matching versions. Scenario C - Alex cloned the repo but forgot to run uv sync and ran code directly. For each scenario, show me the fix commands, explain why they work, and what breaks if I manually edit uv.lock."

**🎯 Practice Environment Recreation:**
> "Walk me through the complete workflow: I'm preparing a UV project for my team to clone. What files do I commit? How do I verify the lockfile is current? Then from my teammate's perspective: exact commands to clone, recreate the environment, and verify it worked. What happens if sync fails?"

**🚀 Build Team Onboarding Guide:**
> "Create a team onboarding checklist for UV projects covering: project maintainer responsibilities (file commits, lockfile verification, README documentation) and new developer steps (cloning, environment setup, verification tests). Add a troubleshooting section with the top 3 mistakes new developers make, showing error messages and fixes for each."
