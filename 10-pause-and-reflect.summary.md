### Core Concept
Strategic synthesis transforms Chapter 3 frameworks into a personal Digital FTE strategy by integrating six dimensions: expertise audit, competitive positioning, monetization model, market entry timeline, readiness assessment, and risk guardrails. The value comes from thinking systematically about YOUR situation.

### Key Mental Models
- **Expertise as Moat**: Your competitive advantage is knowing your specific market better than anyone else entering it—not knowing more than AI, but knowing what AI gets wrong in your domain
- **Layer Alignment**: Match your expertise to the right competitive layer (Layer 2 for technical tools, Layer 3 for domain-specific relationships, Layer 4 for cross-vertical orchestration)
- **Readiness Scoring**: Domain access (8-10 = ready, 5-7 = build requirement first, below 5 = fundamental shift needed)

### Critical Patterns
- Expertise Audit: Identify knowledge that takes competitors 6-12 months to acquire
- Competitive Positioning: Choose layer based on unfair advantage (technical, domain relationships, or orchestration insight)
- Revenue Model Decision: Match model to domain characteristics (HIPAA = License, measurable outcomes = Success Fee, hands-off = Subscription)
- Market Entry Timeline: Adjust PPP phases based on integration complexity and regulatory approval requirements

### Common Mistakes
- Optimizing locally (picking revenue model) while missing global strategy (wrong competitive layer)
- Launching without completing readiness assessment across all three requirements
- Thinking "I'll build a cool AI agent and figure out the business later"—creates features, not products

### Connections
- **Builds on**: All Chapter 3 lessons (expertise positioning, competitive layers, FTE economics, vertical intelligence, monetization, PPP strategy, three requirements, guardrails)
- **Leads to**: Chapter quiz (Lesson 11) and Part 2 implementation
