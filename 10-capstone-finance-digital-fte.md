# Capstone: Building Your Finance Digital FTE

You've built the pieces. Now it's time to assemble the whole.

Throughout this chapter, you've created finance-specific Skills that encode your expertise. You've connected to Google Sheets through MCP. You've designed Subagents for specialized financial roles. You've established governance checkpoints that keep humans in control of critical decisions.

Each component is valuable on its own. Combined into a coherent system, they become something more: a **Finance Digital FTE**—an AI-powered system that handles end-to-end finance workflows with the consistency of automation and the judgment of expertise.

This isn't just a productivity tool. It's a **sellable asset** that packages your finance knowledge into a product other finance teams would pay for.

## The Digital FTE Vision Recap

Remember the Agent Factory thesis from Chapter 1: every domain expert can build AI systems that work 24/7, delivering consistent results at a fraction of human cost. The Digital FTE is the culmination—not a replacement for finance professionals, but an extension of their capabilities.

| What You Built | Role in Digital FTE |
|----------------|---------------------|
| **Skills** (Lesson 3) | Reusable intelligence: variance-analyzer, transaction-classifier |
| **MCP Connections** (Lessons 4, 7) | External systems: Google Sheets, accounting platforms |
| **Subagents** (Lesson 8) | Specialized roles: Modeler, Analyst, Assessor, Validator |
| **Governance** (Lesson 9) | Safety rails: human checkpoints, audit logging, access controls |

A Finance Digital FTE combines all four into a system that can handle recurring workflows—monthly close, quarterly reporting, budget variance analysis—with you directing strategy and approving outputs.

---

## Finance Digital FTE Architecture

Here's how all the pieces fit together:

```
Finance Digital FTE
├── Skills (Reusable Intelligence)
│   ├── variance-analyzer (from Lesson 3)
│   │   └── Identifies significant variances, traces root causes
│   ├── transaction-classifier (from Lesson 3)
│   │   └── Categorizes transactions with confidence levels
│   ├── reconciliation-assistant
│   │   └── Matches bank transactions to GL entries
│   └── narrative-generator
│       └── Converts analysis into stakeholder prose
│
├── MCP Connections (External Systems)
│   ├── Google Sheets MCP (from Lesson 4)
│   │   └── Read/write financial data in spreadsheets
│   └── Accounting Platform MCP (from Lesson 7)
│       └── Fetch transactions, trial balance, journal entries
│
├── Subagents (Specialized Roles)
│   ├── Financial Modeler (from Lesson 8)
│   │   └── Builds forecasts, updates projections
│   ├── Scenario Analyst (from Lesson 8)
│   │   └── Creates what-if comparisons
│   ├── Risk Assessor (from Lesson 8)
│   │   └── Flags exceptions, runs stress tests
│   └── Validator (from Lesson 8)
│       └── Checks data integrity before finalizing
│
└── Governance (Safety Rails)
    ├── Human-in-the-loop checkpoints (from Lesson 9)
    │   └── Approval required before posting/sending
    ├── Audit logging (from Lesson 9)
    │   └── Every AI action documented with reasoning
    └── Access controls (from Lesson 9)
        └── Role-based permissions for sensitive data
```

Each component contributes essential capability. Remove any layer and the system loses either intelligence, connectivity, specialization, or safety.

## From Digital FTE to Sellable Asset

Your Finance Digital FTE isn't just a personal productivity tool. It's intellectual property with market value.

### What Makes It Valuable

1. **Encoded Expertise**: Your variance analysis approach, classification rules, and governance frameworks represent years of professional experience

2. **Consistent Quality**: Unlike manual work that varies with attention and energy, skills produce consistent outputs every time

3. **Scalability**: The same Digital FTE that handles your company's monthly close can handle ten companies' closes with minor customization

4. **Time Compression**: Workflows that take human teams hours compress to minutes of orchestrated AI execution plus focused human review

### Customization Points

When packaging your Digital FTE for other finance teams, they'll need to customize:

| Component | Customization Required |
|-----------|----------------------|
| **CLAUDE.md** | Chart of accounts, thresholds, policies |
| **Skills** | Confidence levels, output formats, escalation triggers |
| **MCP** | Connection credentials, system-specific mappings |
| **Subagents** | Persona adjustments, workflow sequencing |
| **Governance** | Approval hierarchies, audit requirements |

The core logic—your expertise in variance analysis, classification, risk assessment—remains constant. The configuration adapts to each client's context.

### Packaging Options

| Package | What's Included | Target Buyer |
|---------|-----------------|--------------|
| **Skill License** | Individual skills (variance-analyzer, classifier) | Finance teams building their own systems |
| **Workflow Template** | Complete workflow spec + skills | Teams wanting ready-to-configure solutions |
| **Managed Service** | Full Digital FTE + configuration + support | Teams wanting hands-off automation |
| **Custom Build** | Bespoke Digital FTE for specific requirements | Enterprise clients with unique needs |

Your capstone project is the prototype. With refinement and documentation, it becomes the product.

## Try With AI

Complete your capstone by working through these prompts with Claude Code.

### Prompt 1: Design Your Complete Finance Digital FTE

```
Help me design a Finance Digital FTE for [monthly close / accounts receivable /
budget variance / cash forecasting - pick one].

I need:
1. Complete component list: What Skills do I need? What MCP connections?
   What Subagents? Show me how they connect.
2. Workflow sequence: What runs in what order? What's sequential vs parallel?
3. Governance checkpoints: Where does a human need to review?
4. Output specifications: What does the final deliverable look like?

Give me a complete architecture document I can use to implement this.
```

**What you're learning**: This prompt forces you to think through the entire system architecture. You're not just listing components—you're designing how they interact. The architecture document becomes your implementation roadmap. Pay attention to the data flows between components; that's where integration complexity lives.

### Prompt 2: Validate Your Specification

```
Review my capstone specification: [paste your workflow specification]

Evaluate against these criteria:
1. Are all four component types present? (Skills, MCP, Subagents, Governance)
2. Is the workflow sequence clear and complete?
3. Are governance checkpoints sufficient for finance compliance?
4. What's missing for production deployment?

Score each criterion and tell me what to fix.
```

**What you're learning**: Self-review is essential for production systems. This prompt trains you to evaluate your own work against explicit criteria. The scoring forces specificity—you can't hide behind "looks good." When Claude identifies gaps, pay attention to whether they're missing components or unclear specifications. Both matter, but they require different fixes.

### Prompt 3: Package for Sale

```
I've built a Finance Digital FTE for [your workflow choice]. I want to package
it to sell to other finance teams.

Help me think through:
1. What makes this valuable to a buyer? What problem does it solve?
2. What would a buyer need to customize for their company?
3. How would I document it for someone who didn't build it?
4. What pricing model makes sense: license, subscription, or service?

Give me a product positioning statement and customization guide.
```

**What you're learning**: Building is one skill; productizing is another. This prompt shifts your perspective from creator to seller. You're forced to articulate value (not just features), identify customization points (where does your logic end and their context begin?), and think about documentation for users who lack your context. The pricing model question makes the business real—what's the recurring value you're delivering?

**Safety Note**: Your Finance Digital FTE handles sensitive financial data and produces outputs that influence business decisions. Before deploying to production: test with historical data where you know the correct answers, validate all governance checkpoints actually trigger, ensure audit logs capture sufficient detail for compliance review, and maintain human oversight on all material items. The Digital FTE augments your judgment; it never replaces your responsibility for financial accuracy.
