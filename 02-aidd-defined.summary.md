### Core Concept
AIDD is a specification-first methodology that repositions you from code writer to system architect—you write clear specifications of what to build, AI agents handle implementation, and you focus on design, architecture, and validation.

### Key Mental Models
- **Architect vs. Implementer**: Your role shifts from writing syntax to designing systems. AI becomes your implementation team while you remain the decision maker.
- **Nine Characteristics as Identity**: AIDD isn't defined by tools but by principles—Specification-Driven, AI-Augmented, Quality-Gated, Human-Verified, etc. These distinguish it from "just using AI tools."
- **Convergence Enablement**: AIDD required nine technological revolutions to converge. Understanding *why now* prevents treating it as hype.

### Critical Patterns
- Write specifications before code: "Integrate Stripe with retry logic and error logging" instead of debugging async issues manually
- Use the nine characteristics as a checklist: Is your work Specification-Driven? Quality-Gated? Human-Verified?
- Self-assess on the 1-5 paradigm scale to track your transition progress
- Use AI to verify self-assessment: "Interview me to check if my rating is accurate"

### Common Mistakes
- Assuming AIDD means learning less—it actually requires *deeper* understanding of architecture and design
- Expecting tool adoption equals methodology adoption—the specification-first mindset matters more than which AI you use
- Treating AIDD as a success guarantee—it removes access barriers to large markets, but domain complexity and execution still determine outcomes

### Connections
- **Builds on**: Nine technological revolutions from Chapter 2 that made this convergence possible
- **Leads to**: The Nine Enabling Technologies (AI CLI agents, Markdown specs, MCP standard) that make AIDD practical
