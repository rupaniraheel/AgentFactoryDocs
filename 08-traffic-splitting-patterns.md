# Traffic Splitting Patterns

You've deployed version 2 of your Task API. It passed all tests in staging. But staging is not production. Real users behave differently than test suites. Network conditions vary. Edge cases appear that no one anticipated. Shipping a new version directly to 100% of users is gambling—if something breaks, everyone breaks.

Traffic splitting lets you deploy with confidence. Send 5% of traffic to the new version. Watch the error rates. If errors spike, roll back instantly. If metrics look good, increase to 25%, then 50%, then 100%. This is progressive delivery—reducing risk by validating in production with real traffic, while keeping most users safe on the proven version.

This lesson teaches three deployment patterns: canary (gradual rollout), blue-green (instant switch), and A/B testing (feature experiments). You'll implement each using HTTPRoute traffic weights and header-based routing. By the end, you'll deploy new versions without the 3 AM panic of a full cutover gone wrong.

---

## Understanding Traffic Splitting

Traffic splitting divides incoming requests between multiple backend services. Gateway API implements this through HTTPRoute `backendRefs` with `weight` fields.

### How Weights Work

```yaml
backendRefs:
  - name: service-v1
    port: 8000
    weight: 90
  - name: service-v2
    port: 8000
    weight: 10
```

Weights are relative. In this example:
- Total weight: 90 + 10 = 100
- service-v1 receives: 90/100 = 90%
- service-v2 receives: 10/100 = 10%

Weights don't need to sum to 100:

```yaml
backendRefs:
  - name: service-v1
    weight: 9
  - name: service-v2
    weight: 1
```

This produces the same 90/10 split (9/10 = 90%, 1/10 = 10%).

### Three Deployment Patterns

| Pattern | Description | Use When |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| **Canary** | Gradual rollout with increasing traffic | New features, risky changes |
| **Blue-Green** | Instant switch between environments | Database migrations, breaking changes |
| **A/B Testing** | Route specific users to test version | Feature experiments, beta programs |

---

## Canary Deployment

Canary deployment releases changes to a small subset of users first. If the canary version fails, only that subset is affected. The name comes from coal mining—canaries detected toxic gases before miners were harmed.

### Initial Canary Setup (5%)

Deploy version 2 alongside version 1:

```bash
# Deploy canary version
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: task-api-canary
  namespace: task-api
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: task-api
      version: canary
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: task-api
        version: canary
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: task-api
          image: task-api:v2
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8000
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: task-api-canary
  namespace: task-api
spec:
  selector:
    app: task-api
    version: canary
  ports:
    - port: 8000
EOF
```

**Output:**

```
deployment.apps/task-api-canary created
service/task-api-canary created
```

Create HTTPRoute with 5% canary traffic:

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: task-api-canary
  namespace: task-api
spec:
  parentRefs:
    - name: task-api-gateway
  rules:
    - matches:
        - path:
            type: PathPrefix
            value: /api/
      backendRefs:
        - name: task-api-stable
          port: 8000
          weight: 95
        - name: task-api-canary
          port: 8000
          weight: 5
```

**Apply:**

```bash
kubectl apply -f task-api-canary-route.yaml
```

**Output:**

```
httproute.gateway.networking.k8s.io/task-api-canary created
```

### Verify Traffic Split

Send requests and check distribution:

```bash
for i in {1..100}; do
  curl -s http://localhost:8080/api/version | jq -r '.version'
done | sort | uniq -c
```

**Output:**

```
     95 v1
      5 v2
```

Approximately 5% of requests reach the canary.

### Progressive Rollout Stages

As confidence grows, increase canary traffic:

**Stage 1: 5% (initial validation)**

```yaml
backendRefs:
  - name: task-api-stable
    weight: 95
  - name: task-api-canary
    weight: 5
```

**Stage 2: 25% (broader validation)**

```yaml
backendRefs:
  - name: task-api-stable
    weight: 75
  - name: task-api-canary
    weight: 25
```

**Stage 3: 50% (confidence building)**

```yaml
backendRefs:
  - name: task-api-stable
    weight: 50
  - name: task-api-canary
    weight: 50
```

**Stage 4: 100% (full rollout)**

```yaml
backendRefs:
  - name: task-api-canary
    weight: 100
```

After full rollout, rename canary to stable and remove the old deployment.

### Monitoring During Canary

Watch error rates between versions:

```bash
# Compare error rates
kubectl logs -l version=stable -n task-api --tail=100 | grep -c ERROR
kubectl logs -l version=canary -n task-api --tail=100 | grep -c ERROR
```

**Output:**

```
3   # stable errors
12  # canary errors - 4x higher!
```

If canary shows significantly higher errors, rollback immediately.

---

## Canary Rollback

When canary metrics look bad, rollback is one YAML change away.

### Immediate Rollback

Shift all traffic back to stable:

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: task-api-canary
  namespace: task-api
spec:
  parentRefs:
    - name: task-api-gateway
  rules:
    - matches:
        - path:
            type: PathPrefix
            value: /api/
      backendRefs:
        - name: task-api-stable
          port: 8000
          weight: 100
        - name: task-api-canary
          port: 8000
          weight: 0
```

**Apply:**

```bash
kubectl apply -f task-api-canary-route.yaml
```

**Output:**

```
httproute.gateway.networking.k8s.io/task-api-canary configured
```

Traffic instantly stops going to canary. Requests in flight complete, but no new requests reach the problematic version.

### Verify Rollback

```bash
for i in {1..20}; do
  curl -s http://localhost:8080/api/version | jq -r '.version'
done | sort | uniq -c
```

**Output:**

```
     20 v1
```

All traffic now goes to stable.

### Cleanup Failed Canary

After rollback, clean up the failed deployment:

```bash
kubectl delete deployment task-api-canary -n task-api
kubectl delete service task-api-canary -n task-api
```

**Output:**

```
deployment.apps "task-api-canary" deleted
service "task-api-canary" deleted
```

## Blue-Green Deployment

Blue-green deployment maintains two identical environments. One serves production traffic (blue), the other sits idle with the new version (green). When ready, you switch all traffic instantly.

### When to Use Blue-Green

| Scenario | Pattern |
|----------|---------|
| Database schema changes | Blue-green (clean cutover) |
| Breaking API changes | Blue-green (all-or-nothing) |
| Regulatory compliance | Blue-green (auditable switch) |
| Gradual feature rollout | Canary (progressive) |
| Performance testing | Canary (compare metrics) |

### Setting Up Blue-Green

Deploy both environments:

```bash
# Blue environment (current production)
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: task-api-blue
  namespace: task-api
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: task-api
      environment: blue
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: task-api
        environment: blue
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: task-api
          image: task-api:v1
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8000
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: task-api-blue
  namespace: task-api
spec:
  selector:
    app: task-api
    environment: blue
  ports:
    - port: 8000
EOF
```

```bash
# Green environment (new version, idle)
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: task-api-green
  namespace: task-api
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: task-api
      environment: green
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: task-api
        environment: green
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: task-api
          image: task-api:v2
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8000
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: task-api-green
  namespace: task-api
spec:
  selector:
    app: task-api
    environment: green
  ports:
    - port: 8000
EOF
```

**Output:**

```
deployment.apps/task-api-blue created
service/task-api-blue created
deployment.apps/task-api-green created
service/task-api-green created
```

### Initial State: Blue Active

Route all traffic to blue:

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: task-api-bluegreen
  namespace: task-api
spec:
  parentRefs:
    - name: task-api-gateway
  rules:
    - matches:
        - path:
            type: PathPrefix
            value: /api/
      backendRefs:
        - name: task-api-blue
          port: 8000
          weight: 100
        - name: task-api-green
          port: 8000
          weight: 0
```

### Switch to Green

When green is validated and ready:

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: task-api-bluegreen
  namespace: task-api
spec:
  parentRefs:
    - name: task-api-gateway
  rules:
    - matches:
        - path:
            type: PathPrefix
            value: /api/
      backendRefs:
        - name: task-api-blue
          port: 8000
          weight: 0
        - name: task-api-green
          port: 8000
          weight: 100
```

**Apply:**

```bash
kubectl apply -f task-api-bluegreen-route.yaml
```

**Output:**

```
httproute.gateway.networking.k8s.io/task-api-bluegreen configured
```

Traffic instantly switches to green. To rollback, swap weights back.

### Blue-Green Rollback

If green has issues, instant rollback:

```yaml
backendRefs:
  - name: task-api-blue
    weight: 100
  - name: task-api-green
    weight: 0
```

The old environment is still running—just flip the switch.

## A/B Testing with Headers

A/B testing routes specific users to different versions. Unlike canary (random percentage), A/B testing is deterministic—users with certain attributes always see the test version.

### Header-Based Routing

Route beta users to the experimental version:

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: task-api-ab
  namespace: task-api
spec:
  parentRefs:
    - name: task-api-gateway
  rules:
    # Beta users see experimental version
    - matches:
        - path:
            type: PathPrefix
            value: /api/
          headers:
            - name: x-beta-user
              value: "true"
      backendRefs:
        - name: task-api-experimental
          port: 8000

    # Everyone else sees stable version
    - matches:
        - path:
            type: PathPrefix
            value: /api/
      backendRefs:
        - name: task-api-stable
          port: 8000
```

**Apply:**

```bash
kubectl apply -f task-api-ab-route.yaml
```

**Output:**

```
httproute.gateway.networking.k8s.io/task-api-ab created
```

### Test A/B Routing

```bash
# Regular user sees stable
curl http://localhost:8080/api/version
```

**Output:**

```json
{"version": "stable", "features": ["core"]}
```

```bash
# Beta user sees experimental
curl -H "x-beta-user: true" http://localhost:8080/api/version
```

**Output:**

```json
{"version": "experimental", "features": ["core", "ai-suggestions", "smart-tags"]}
```

### Premium Tier Routing

Route premium users to dedicated infrastructure:

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: task-api-premium
  namespace: task-api
spec:
  parentRefs:
    - name: task-api-gateway
  rules:
    # Premium API keys get dedicated backend
    - matches:
        - path:
            type: PathPrefix
            value: /api/
          headers:
            - name: x-api-tier
              value: "premium"
      backendRefs:
        - name: task-api-premium
          port: 8000

    # Standard users share the main backend
    - matches:
        - path:
            type: PathPrefix
            value: /api/
      backendRefs:
        - name: task-api-standard
          port: 8000
```

Premium users get:
- Dedicated pods (no noisy neighbors)
- Higher rate limits
- Priority during high load

---

## Combining Patterns

Real deployments often combine patterns. Canary the new version to 10% of standard users while all premium users stay on stable.

### Canary with Premium Protection

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: task-api-combined
  namespace: task-api
spec:
  parentRefs:
    - name: task-api-gateway
  rules:
    # Premium users ALWAYS get stable (no experiments)
    - matches:
        - path:
            type: PathPrefix
            value: /api/
          headers:
            - name: x-api-tier
              value: "premium"
      backendRefs:
        - name: task-api-stable
          port: 8000
          weight: 100

    # Standard users get canary rollout
    - matches:
        - path:
            type: PathPrefix
            value: /api/
      backendRefs:
        - name: task-api-stable
          port: 8000
          weight: 90
        - name: task-api-canary
          port: 8000
          weight: 10
```

Premium users are protected—they never see the canary. Standard users get the gradual rollout.

---

## Monitoring Traffic Split Results

Traffic splitting without monitoring is flying blind. You need to see error rates, latency, and throughput per version.

### Prometheus Queries

**Error rate by version:**

```promql
sum(rate(http_requests_total{status=~"5.."}[5m])) by (version)
/
sum(rate(http_requests_total[5m])) by (version)
```

**Latency by version (p99):**

```promql
histogram_quantile(0.99,
  sum(rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket[5m])) by (version, le)
)
```

**Requests per second by version:**

```promql
sum(rate(http_requests_total[5m])) by (version)
```

### Quick Health Check Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# compare-versions.sh

echo "Comparing stable vs canary..."

# Error rates
STABLE_ERRORS=$(kubectl logs -l version=stable -n task-api --tail=1000 | grep -c ERROR)
CANARY_ERRORS=$(kubectl logs -l version=canary -n task-api --tail=1000 | grep -c ERROR)

echo "Stable errors: $STABLE_ERRORS"
echo "Canary errors: $CANARY_ERRORS"

if [ "$CANARY_ERRORS" -gt $((STABLE_ERRORS * 2)) ]; then
  echo "WARNING: Canary error rate is more than 2x stable!"
  echo "Consider rollback."
fi
```

**Run:**

```bash
chmod +x compare-versions.sh
./compare-versions.sh
```

**Output:**

```
Comparing stable vs canary...
Stable errors: 3
Canary errors: 2
```

Canary looks healthy—proceed with rollout.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Create a Canary Deployment

Set up 10% canary traffic:

```bash
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: exercise-canary
  namespace: default
spec:
  parentRefs:
    - name: task-api-gateway
  rules:
    - matches:
        - path:
            type: PathPrefix
            value: /api/
      backendRefs:
        - name: task-api-stable
          port: 8000
          weight: 90
        - name: task-api-canary
          port: 8000
          weight: 10
EOF
```

**Verify:**

```bash
kubectl get httproute exercise-canary -o yaml | grep -A6 backendRefs
```

**Expected Output:**

```yaml
      backendRefs:
      - name: task-api-stable
        port: 8000
        weight: 90
      - name: task-api-canary
        port: 8000
        weight: 10
```

### Exercise 2: Configure A/B Testing

Route beta users to a test version:

```bash
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: exercise-ab
  namespace: default
spec:
  parentRefs:
    - name: task-api-gateway
  rules:
    - matches:
        - path:
            type: PathPrefix
            value: /api/
          headers:
            - name: x-beta-user
              value: "true"
      backendRefs:
        - name: task-api-beta
          port: 8000
    - matches:
        - path:
            type: PathPrefix
            value: /api/
      backendRefs:
        - name: task-api-stable
          port: 8000
EOF
```

**Test (if services exist):**

```bash
# Beta user
curl -H "x-beta-user: true" http://localhost:8080/api/version

# Regular user
curl http://localhost:8080/api/version
```

### Exercise 3: Blue-Green Switch

Create blue-green configuration and switch environments:

```bash
# Initial: blue active
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: exercise-bluegreen
  namespace: default
spec:
  parentRefs:
    - name: task-api-gateway
  rules:
    - matches:
        - path:
            type: PathPrefix
            value: /api/
      backendRefs:
        - name: task-api-blue
          port: 8000
          weight: 100
        - name: task-api-green
          port: 8000
          weight: 0
EOF
```

**Switch to green (modify and reapply):**

```bash
kubectl patch httproute exercise-bluegreen -n default --type=merge -p '
{
  "spec": {
    "rules": [{
      "matches": [{"path": {"type": "PathPrefix", "value": "/api/"}}],
      "backendRefs": [
        {"name": "task-api-blue", "port": 8000, "weight": 0},
        {"name": "task-api-green", "port": 8000, "weight": 100}
      ]
    }]
  }
}'
```

**Expected Output:**

```
httproute.gateway.networking.k8s.io/exercise-bluegreen patched
```

### Exercise 4: Rollback Canary

Practice rollback by setting canary weight to 0:

```bash
kubectl patch httproute exercise-canary -n default --type=merge -p '
{
  "spec": {
    "rules": [{
      "matches": [{"path": {"type": "PathPrefix", "value": "/api/"}}],
      "backendRefs": [
        {"name": "task-api-stable", "port": 8000, "weight": 100},
        {"name": "task-api-canary", "port": 8000, "weight": 0}
      ]
    }]
  }
}'
```

**Verify:**

```bash
kubectl get httproute exercise-canary -o yaml | grep -A6 backendRefs
```

**Expected Output:**

```yaml
      backendRefs:
      - name: task-api-stable
        port: 8000
        weight: 100
      - name: task-api-canary
        port: 8000
        weight: 0
```

## Reflect on Your Skill

You built a `traffic-engineer` skill in Lesson 0. Based on what you learned about traffic splitting:

### Add Deployment Pattern Templates

Your skill should generate configuration for each pattern:

**Canary template:**

```yaml
# Template: canary-deployment
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: {{ service }}-canary
  namespace: {{ namespace }}
spec:
  parentRefs:
    - name: {{ gateway }}
  rules:
    - matches:
        - path:
            type: PathPrefix
            value: {{ path_prefix }}
      backendRefs:
        - name: {{ stable_service }}
          port: {{ port }}
          weight: {{ stable_weight }}
        - name: {{ canary_service }}
          port: {{ port }}
          weight: {{ canary_weight }}
```

**Blue-green template:**

```yaml
# Template: blue-green
backendRefs:
  - name: {{ service }}-blue
    port: {{ port }}
    weight: {{ blue_weight }}
  - name: {{ service }}-green
    port: {{ port }}
    weight: {{ green_weight }}
```

**A/B testing template:**

```yaml
# Template: ab-testing
rules:
  - matches:
      - path:
          type: PathPrefix
          value: {{ path_prefix }}
        headers:
          - name: {{ header_name }}
            value: {{ header_value }}
    backendRefs:
      - name: {{ test_service }}
        port: {{ port }}
  - matches:
      - path:
          type: PathPrefix
          value: {{ path_prefix }}
    backendRefs:
      - name: {{ stable_service }}
        port: {{ port }}
```

### Decision Framework for Your Skill

| Question | If Yes | If No |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Need instant switch? | Blue-green | Canary |
| Testing specific users? | A/B testing | Canary |
| Database migration? | Blue-green | Canary |
| Gradual risk reduction? | Canary | Blue-green |

### Rollback Guidance

Your skill should include rollback commands:

```bash
# Canary rollback: set canary weight to 0
kubectl patch httproute {{ route }} --type=merge -p '{"spec":...}'

# Blue-green rollback: swap weights
# From green (100) back to blue (100)
```

## Try With AI

### Generate Canary Configuration

Ask your traffic-engineer skill:

```
Using my traffic-engineer skill, generate a canary deployment configuration
for my Task API:

- Stable service: task-api-stable (port 8000)
- Canary service: task-api-canary (port 8000)
- Initial split: 95% stable, 5% canary
- Namespace: task-api
- Gateway: task-api-gateway
- Path prefix: /api/
```

**What you're learning**: AI generates traffic splitting configurations. Review the output—are weights correct? Is the path matching appropriate? Do the service names match your request?

### Evaluate and Extend

Check AI's output:

- Do weights sum correctly for the intended split?
- Is the HTTPRoute in the correct namespace?
- Are `parentRefs` pointing to your gateway?

If you need progressive stages, ask:

```
Now generate the HTTPRoute for stage 2: 75% stable, 25% canary.
```

**What you're learning**: AI adapts configurations through iteration. Compare the stage 1 and stage 2 outputs—only weights should change.

### Add A/B Testing Layer

Extend for premium user protection:

```
Add a rule BEFORE the canary split that routes x-api-tier: premium
users to task-api-stable with 100% weight. Premium users should
never see the canary.
```

**What you're learning**: Rule ordering matters. AI should place the premium rule first so it matches before the general canary rule.

### Generate Rollback Command

Ask for operational commands:

```
Generate the kubectl patch command to rollback this canary to 0% traffic
while keeping 100% on stable.
```

**What you're learning**: AI generates operational commands, not just YAML. Review the patch syntax—is it correct for your HTTPRoute?

### Safety Note

Traffic splitting affects real users in production. Always test configurations with `kubectl apply --dry-run=client` first. Start canary deployments with small percentages (1-5%) and monitor error rates before increasing. Keep rollback commands ready—you may need them at 3 AM.
