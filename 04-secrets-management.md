# Secrets Management

In January 2023, CircleCI disclosed a security incident affecting thousands of customer projects. Attackers had accessed stored secrets—API keys, OAuth tokens, SSH keys—because they were stored as environment variables visible in build logs and process listings. The incident affected companies from startups to enterprises, requiring emergency credential rotation across their entire infrastructure.

Your Task API needs database credentials, API keys, and service tokens. How you store and consume these secrets determines whether a container escape becomes a minor incident or a catastrophic breach. Environment variables—the most common approach—are also the most dangerous because they appear in process listings, crash dumps, and debugging output.

This lesson teaches you the secure pattern: **volume mounts for secret consumption**. You'll also understand where Kubernetes Secrets fit in the broader secrets hierarchy, from development conveniences to production-grade external secret managers.

---

## The Problem with Environment Variables

Before learning the secure pattern, understand why the common pattern fails.

### Why Teams Use Environment Variables

Environment variables are convenient:

```yaml
# DANGEROUS - commonly used but insecure
containers:
- name: task-api
  env:
  - name: DATABASE_PASSWORD
    valueFrom:
      secretKeyRef:
        name: db-credentials
        key: password
```

The secret value becomes accessible via `$DATABASE_PASSWORD` in your application. Simple, readable, supported by every framework. But fundamentally insecure.

### Environment Variable Attack Surface

| Exposure Vector | How Secrets Leak |
|-----------------|------------------|
| **Process listing** | `ps auxe` shows environment variables to any user on the node |
| **Container inspection** | `docker inspect` exposes all env vars in plaintext |
| **Crash dumps** | Core dumps include environment in memory snapshot |
| **Logging** | Libraries often log startup configuration including env vars |
| **Child processes** | Spawned processes inherit parent's environment |
| **Kubernetes API** | Pod spec in etcd contains env var values |

A single debugging command can expose your production database password:

```bash
# Anyone with node access can see container environment
docker inspect task-api-container | grep -A 50 "Env"
```

**Output:**

```json
"Env": [
    "DATABASE_PASSWORD=SuperSecretPassword123",
    "API_KEY=sk-prod-abc123xyz..."
]
```

---

## Volume Mounts: The Secure Alternative

Volume mounts project secrets as files inside the container. This approach eliminates most environment variable attack vectors.

### How Volume Mounts Work

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    Volume Mount Pattern                      │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                              │
│  K8s Secret ──► Volume ──► File in Container                │
│                                                              │
│  db-credentials         /etc/secrets/                       │
│  ├── username    ──►    ├── username (file containing value)│
│  └── password    ──►    └── password (file containing value)│
│                                                              │
│  App reads: open("/etc/secrets/password").read()            │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Your application reads credentials from files instead of environment variables. This simple change eliminates five of the six exposure vectors above.

### Security Comparison

| Concern | Environment Variables | Volume Mounts |
|---------|----------------------|---------------|
| Process listing (`ps`) | Exposed | Not visible |
| Container inspection | Exposed | Not visible |
| Child process inheritance | Inherited | Not inherited |
| Crash dumps | Included | Not included |
| Logging frameworks | Often logged | Rarely logged |
| Kubernetes etcd | Stored in pod spec | Stored in Secret only |
| File permissions | N/A | Configurable (0400) |

Volume mounts keep secrets out of the execution environment entirely. They exist only as files with restricted permissions.

---

## Creating Kubernetes Secrets

Kubernetes Secrets store sensitive data as key-value pairs. Values are base64-encoded (NOT encrypted) in etcd.

### Method 1: Create from Literals

For individual values, use `--from-literal`:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic db-credentials \
  -n task-api \
  --from-literal=username=task_api_user \
  --from-literal=password='SuperSecretPassword123!'
```

**Output:**

```
secret/db-credentials created
```

Verify the Secret exists:

```bash
kubectl get secret db-credentials -n task-api -o yaml
```

**Output:**

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: db-credentials
  namespace: task-api
type: Opaque
data:
  password: U3VwZXJTZWNyZXRQYXNzd29yZDEyMyE=
  username: dGFza19hcGlfdXNlcg==
```

The values are base64-encoded. Decode to verify:

```bash
echo "U3VwZXJTZWNyZXRQYXNzd29yZDEyMyE=" | base64 -d
```

**Output:**

```
SuperSecretPassword123!
```

:::warning Base64 is NOT Encryption
Base64 encoding is reversible by anyone. It provides zero security—only encoding convenience. Anyone with `kubectl get secret` access can decode your credentials instantly. Kubernetes stores Secrets in etcd, which should have encryption-at-rest enabled in production.
:::

### Method 2: Create from Files

For certificates, keys, or complex credentials, use `--from-file`:

```bash
# Create files with credentials
echo -n "task_api_user" > username.txt
echo -n "SuperSecretPassword123!" > password.txt

# Create Secret from files
kubectl create secret generic db-credentials-file \
  -n task-api \
  --from-file=username=username.txt \
  --from-file=password=password.txt

# Clean up plaintext files immediately
rm username.txt password.txt
```

**Output:**

```
secret/db-credentials-file created
```

The `--from-file` approach is essential for multi-line values like TLS certificates:

```bash
kubectl create secret tls task-api-tls \
  -n task-api \
  --cert=server.crt \
  --key=server.key
```

**Output:**

```
secret/task-api-tls created
```

---

## Consuming Secrets via Volume Mount

Mount your Secret as a volume in the pod spec:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: task-api
  namespace: task-api
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: task-api
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: task-api
    spec:
      serviceAccountName: task-api-sa
      containers:
      - name: task-api
        image: ghcr.io/your-org/task-api:v1.0.0
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8000
        volumeMounts:
        - name: db-credentials
          mountPath: /etc/secrets/db
          readOnly: true
      volumes:
      - name: db-credentials
        secret:
          secretName: db-credentials
          defaultMode: 0400  # Read-only for owner
```

**Key elements:**

| Element | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `volumeMounts.mountPath` | Directory where secrets appear as files |
| `volumeMounts.readOnly: true` | Prevent accidental writes |
| `volumes.secret.secretName` | Reference to your Secret |
| `defaultMode: 0400` | File permissions (owner read-only) |

Apply the deployment:

```bash
kubectl apply -f task-api-deployment.yaml
```

**Output:**

```
deployment.apps/task-api created
```

### Verify Volume Mount

Check that secrets are mounted correctly:

```bash
kubectl exec -n task-api deploy/task-api -- ls -la /etc/secrets/db/
```

**Output:**

```
total 0
drwxrwxrwt 3 root root 120 Jan 15 10:30 .
drwxr-xr-x 3 root root  60 Jan 15 10:30 ..
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root  15 Jan 15 10:30 password -> ..data/password
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root  15 Jan 15 10:30 username -> ..data/username
```

Read the secret value:

```bash
kubectl exec -n task-api deploy/task-api -- cat /etc/secrets/db/password
```

**Output:**

```
SuperSecretPassword123!
```

### Application Code Pattern

Your application reads credentials from files:

```python
# Python example
def get_db_password():
    with open('/etc/secrets/db/password', 'r') as f:
        return f.read().strip()

# Use in connection string
db_url = f"postgresql://{get_db_username()}:{get_db_password()}@postgres:5432/tasks"
```

```typescript
// TypeScript example
import { readFileSync } from 'fs';

function getDbPassword(): string {
  return readFileSync('/etc/secrets/db/password', 'utf-8').trim();
}
```

---

## Mounting Specific Keys

You can mount individual keys to specific file paths:

```yaml
volumes:
- name: db-credentials
  secret:
    secretName: db-credentials
    items:
    - key: password
      path: db-password  # Creates /etc/secrets/db/db-password
    - key: username
      path: db-username  # Creates /etc/secrets/db/db-username
```

This is useful when your application expects specific filenames.

---

## The Secrets Management Hierarchy

Kubernetes Secrets are the foundation, but production environments need more:

```

│              Secrets Management Hierarchy                    │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                              │

│                           │                                  │
│  Level 1: K8s Secrets (Development)                         │
│  ├── Base64-encoded in etcd                                 │

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### When to Use Each Level

| Scenario | Recommended Level | Why |
|----------|-------------------|-----|
| Local development | K8s Secrets | Simple, no setup required |
| Single-cluster GitOps | Sealed Secrets | Encrypted secrets in git |
| Multi-cluster production | External Secrets Operator | Centralized management |
| Compliance requirements (SOC2, HIPAA) | External Secrets Operator | Audit trails, rotation |
| Secret rotation needed | External Secrets Operator | Automatic sync |

### Sealed Secrets Overview

Sealed Secrets (Bitnami) encrypts secrets with a cluster-specific key. The encrypted `SealedSecret` resource is safe to commit to git:

```yaml
# This is SAFE to commit to git
apiVersion: bitnami.com/v1alpha1
kind: SealedSecret
metadata:
  name: db-credentials
  namespace: task-api
spec:
  encryptedData:
    password: AgBy8hCi...long-encrypted-string...
    username: AgCtr4Kx...long-encrypted-string...
```

Only the controller running in your cluster can decrypt it. Different clusters have different keys, so secrets stay cluster-specific.

### External Secrets Operator Overview

External Secrets Operator (ESO) syncs secrets from external stores into Kubernetes:

```yaml
# ExternalSecret definition
apiVersion: external-secrets.io/v1beta1
kind: ExternalSecret
metadata:
  name: db-credentials
  namespace: task-api
spec:
  refreshInterval: 1h
  secretStoreRef:
    name: vault-backend
    kind: SecretStore
  target:
    name: db-credentials
  data:
  - secretKey: password
    remoteRef:
      key: secret/data/task-api/db
      property: password
```

ESO creates a standard Kubernetes Secret that your pods consume via volume mount—the same pattern you learned above. The difference is where the source of truth lives (external vault) and that ESO handles rotation automatically.

## Task API Secret Configuration

Here's the complete Secret and volume mount configuration for Task API. Create `task-api-secrets.yaml`:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: task-api-secrets
  namespace: task-api
type: Opaque
stringData:  # stringData auto-encodes to base64
  db-password: "YourSecurePassword123!"
  api-key: "sk-prod-your-api-key-here"
  jwt-secret: "your-jwt-signing-secret"
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: task-api
  namespace: task-api
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: task-api
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: task-api
    spec:
      serviceAccountName: task-api-sa
      automountServiceAccountToken: false
      securityContext:
        runAsNonRoot: true
        runAsUser: 1000
        fsGroup: 1000
      containers:
      - name: task-api
        image: ghcr.io/your-org/task-api:v1.0.0
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8000
        securityContext:
          allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
          readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
          capabilities:
            drop: ["ALL"]
        volumeMounts:
        - name: secrets
          mountPath: /etc/secrets
          readOnly: true
        - name: tmp
          mountPath: /tmp
      volumes:
      - name: secrets
        secret:
          secretName: task-api-secrets
          defaultMode: 0400
      - name: tmp
        emptyDir: {}
```

Apply the configuration:

```bash
kubectl apply -f task-api-secrets.yaml
```

**Output:**

```
secret/task-api-secrets created
deployment.apps/task-api created
```

## Reflect on Your Skill

Test your `cloud-security` skill against secrets management:

```
Using my cloud-security skill, generate a Secret and Deployment
configuration for an application that needs:
- Database credentials (username and password)
- An external API key
- A TLS certificate and key

Use volume mounts, not environment variables.
```

**Evaluation questions:**

1. Does your skill default to volume mounts instead of environment variables?
2. Does your skill set `defaultMode: 0400` for restrictive file permissions?
3. Does your skill include the `readOnly: true` flag on volumeMounts?
4. Does your skill warn about base64 encoding vs encryption?
5. Does your skill mention when to escalate to Sealed Secrets or ESO?

If any answers are "no," update your skill with the patterns from this lesson.

## Try With AI

Practice secrets management patterns and troubleshooting.

**Prompt 1:**

```
My application can't read secrets from /etc/secrets/db/password.
The file doesn't exist. Here's my pod spec:

volumeMounts:
- name: credentials
  mountPath: /etc/secrets/db
volumes:
- name: credentials
  secret:
    secretName: database-creds

The Secret database-creds exists. What's wrong?
```

**What you're learning:** Common volume mount debugging. The issue could be namespace mismatch (Secret in different namespace than pod), Secret key names don't match expected paths, or the Secret was created after the pod started. The skill should walk through verification steps: checking Secret exists in same namespace, verifying key names, and restarting the pod if Secret was created late.

**Prompt 2:**

```
Convert this environment variable configuration to use volume mounts:

containers:
- name: app
  env:
  - name: DB_PASSWORD
    valueFrom:
      secretKeyRef:
        name: db-creds
        key: password
  - name: API_KEY
    valueFrom:
      secretKeyRef:
        name: api-creds
        key: key
```

**What you're learning:** Migration pattern from environment variables to volume mounts. Notice how the conversion requires both volumeMount entries and volume definitions. The application code also needs updating to read from files instead of environment variables.

**Prompt 3:**

```
Our security team requires that all secrets:
1. Rotate every 90 days automatically
2. Have audit trails for access
3. Work across 5 Kubernetes clusters

Should we use K8s Secrets, Sealed Secrets, or External Secrets Operator?
Explain your recommendation.
```

**What you're learning:** How to select the appropriate level in the secrets hierarchy based on requirements. Rotation and audit requirements point to External Secrets Operator with a backend like HashiCorp Vault. Multi-cluster also favors centralized management. The skill should explain why K8s Secrets and Sealed Secrets don't meet these requirements.

:::warning Security Reminder
Never commit plaintext secrets to git, even temporarily. Use `kubectl create secret` imperatively or Sealed Secrets for GitOps workflows. Base64 encoding provides zero security—anyone with cluster access can decode your secrets instantly.
