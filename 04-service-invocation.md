# Service Invocation

Your todo-api stores tasks in Redis through Dapr's state API. But real systems don't live in isolation. When a task is created, you need to notify users. When a task is completed, you might update a billing service. Microservices talk to each other constantly.

In traditional architectures, service-to-service calls require solving several problems: How does todo-api find notification-service? What if notification-service moves to a different IP? How do you secure the traffic? What happens when notification-service is temporarily down?

Dapr's service invocation building block solves all of these with a single API call. You call `localhost:3500/v1.0/invoke/{app-id}/method/{method}`, and Dapr handles discovery, load balancing, mTLS encryption, and retries. Your code never knows where the target service actually lives or how to reach it securely.

By the end of this lesson, your todo-api will call a notification-service through Dapr, with automatic service discovery and encrypted traffic.

## The Service Invocation API

Dapr exposes service invocation through a simple HTTP endpoint:

```
POST http://localhost:3500/v1.0/invoke/{app-id}/method/{method-name}
```

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `localhost:3500` | Your local Dapr sidecar |
| `app-id` | Target service's unique identifier (from `dapr.io/app-id` annotation) |
| `method-name` | The endpoint path on the target service |

When you call this endpoint:
1. Your Dapr sidecar looks up `app-id` in the cluster's name resolution
2. Establishes an mTLS connection to the target service's sidecar
3. Forwards your request to the target application
4. Returns the response to you

No hardcoded URLs. No certificate management. No service registry configuration.

## How Service Discovery Works

On Kubernetes, Dapr uses the mDNS (multicast DNS) or Kubernetes DNS for service discovery. Each service announces itself using its `dapr.io/app-id` annotation. When todo-api wants to call notification-service:

```
todo-api (app) → todo-api-sidecar → [Kubernetes DNS lookup: notification-service]
                                         ↓
notification-service (app) ← notification-service-sidecar
```

The key insight: **you never configure the target service's address**. Dapr resolves `notification-service` to the correct pod automatically. If notification-service scales to 10 replicas, Dapr load-balances across them.

## Automatic mTLS with Sentry

Here's what happens behind the scenes that you don't have to configure:

The **Dapr Sentry** service acts as a Certificate Authority. When each sidecar starts:

1. Sidecar generates a private key
2. Sends a certificate signing request to Sentry
3. Sentry issues a certificate with a SPIFFE identity: `spiffe://<trustdomain>/ns/<namespace>/<app-id>`
4. Sidecar uses this certificate for all service-to-service calls

Every call between sidecars is encrypted with mTLS. Certificate rotation happens automatically (default: every 24 hours). You write zero TLS code.

```
┌─────────────────┐         mTLS           ┌─────────────────┐
│   todo-api      │◄───────────────────────►│ notification-   │
│   sidecar       │   (encrypted traffic)  │ service sidecar │
└─────────────────┘                        └─────────────────┘
         ▲                                          ▲
         │ cert                              cert   │
         └──────────────► Sentry ◄──────────────────┘
                         (CA)
```

## Creating a Notification Service

Let's create a simple notification service that todo-api will call:

```python
# notification_service.py
from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

app = FastAPI()

class NotificationRequest(BaseModel):
    message: str
    task_id: str | None = None

@app.post("/notify")
async def notify(request: NotificationRequest):
    """Receive notification from other services."""
    logger.info(f"Notification received: {request.message}")

    # In production: send email, push notification, Slack message, etc.
    return {
        "status": "delivered",
        "message": request.message
    }

@app.get("/health")
async def health():
    return {"status": "healthy"}
```

**Output:**

```
INFO:     Notification received: Todo created: Buy groceries
```

This service runs on port 8001. Nothing Dapr-specific in the code itself.

## Deploying with Dapr Annotations

Both services need Dapr sidecar injection. The key annotations:

```yaml
# k8s/notification-service.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: notification-service
  namespace: default
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: notification-service
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: notification-service
      annotations:
        dapr.io/enabled: "true"
        dapr.io/app-id: "notification-service"
        dapr.io/app-port: "8001"
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: notification-service
          image: notification-service:latest
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8001
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: notification-service
  namespace: default
spec:
  selector:
    app: notification-service
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 8001
```

**Three critical annotations:**

| Annotation | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| `dapr.io/enabled: "true"` | Triggers sidecar injection |
| `dapr.io/app-id: "notification-service"` | Service's unique name for discovery |
| `dapr.io/app-port: "8001"` | Port your app listens on (sidecar forwards here) |

Apply the deployment:

```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/notification-service.yaml
```

**Output:**

```
deployment.apps/notification-service created
service/notification-service created
```

Verify the sidecar is injected:

```bash
kubectl get pods -l app=notification-service
```

**Output:**

```
NAME                                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
notification-service-7d9f8c6b4-xk2mn   2/2     Running   0          30s
```

`2/2` means two containers: your app and the Dapr sidecar.

## Calling from Todo-API with Python SDK

Now update todo-api to call notification-service when a task is created:

```python
# todo_api.py
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from dapr.clients import DaprClient
from pydantic import BaseModel
import json
import uuid

app = FastAPI()

class Task(BaseModel):
    id: str | None = None
    title: str
    status: str = "pending"

@app.post("/tasks", response_model=Task)
async def create_task(task: Task):
    task.id = str(uuid.uuid4())

    with DaprClient() as client:
        # Save state (from L03)
        client.save_state(
            store_name='statestore',
            key=f'task-{task.id}',
            value=task.model_dump_json()
        )

        # Notify via service invocation
        response = client.invoke_method(
            app_id='notification-service',
            method_name='notify',
            http_verb='POST',
            data=json.dumps({
                "message": f"Todo created: {task.title}",
                "task_id": task.id
            }),
            content_type='application/json'
        )

        print(f"Notification response: {response.text()}")

    return task
```

**Output:**

```
Notification response: {"status": "delivered", "message": "Todo created: Buy groceries"}
```

The `invoke_method()` parameters:

| Parameter | Value | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| `app_id` | `'notification-service'` | Target service's dapr.io/app-id |
| `method_name` | `'notify'` | Endpoint path on target service |
| `http_verb` | `'POST'` | HTTP method |
| `data` | JSON string | Request body |
| `content_type` | `'application/json'` | Content-Type header |

## Alternative: HTTP with dapr-app-id Header

If you prefer raw HTTP calls over the SDK, use the `dapr-app-id` header:

```python
import httpx
import os

DAPR_HTTP_PORT = os.getenv("DAPR_HTTP_PORT", "3500")

async def notify_via_http(message: str, task_id: str):
    """Call notification-service using HTTP with dapr-app-id header."""
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        response = await client.post(
            f"http://localhost:{DAPR_HTTP_PORT}/notify",
            json={"message": message, "task_id": task_id},
            headers={"dapr-app-id": "notification-service"}
        )
        return response.json()
```

**Output:**

```python
>>> await notify_via_http("Task completed", "task-123")
{"status": "delivered", "message": "Task completed"}
```

The `dapr-app-id` header tells your sidecar which service to route to. This is equivalent to the `/v1.0/invoke/{app-id}/method/{method}` endpoint pattern.

## Debugging Service Invocation

When `invoke_method()` fails, the error tells you what went wrong:

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| `ERR_DIRECT_INVOKE: app-id notification-service not found` | Target service not running or wrong app-id | Check `kubectl get pods`, verify annotation |
| `connection refused` | Target service's app-port incorrect | Verify `dapr.io/app-port` matches your app |
| `DEADLINE_EXCEEDED` | Target service too slow | Increase timeout or check target health |

Enable API logging to see invocation details:

```yaml
annotations:
  dapr.io/enable-api-logging: "true"
```

Then check sidecar logs:

```bash
kubectl logs todo-api-pod -c daprd | grep invoke
```

**Output:**

```
level=info msg="HTTP API Called" method=POST app_id=notification-service method=notify
```

## Reflect on Your Skill

You built a `dapr-deployment` skill in Lesson 0. Update it with service invocation patterns.

### Add to Your Skill

```
Update my dapr-deployment skill with service invocation patterns:
1. invoke_method() Python SDK usage
2. Required annotations: dapr.io/enabled, dapr.io/app-id, dapr.io/app-port
3. Alternative: dapr-app-id HTTP header pattern
4. Common errors: ERR_DIRECT_INVOKE, connection refused
5. Debugging: enable-api-logging annotation
```

### Test Your Improved Skill

```
Using my dapr-deployment skill, generate code for a billing-service
that todo-api calls when a task is marked complete. Include:
- Deployment YAML with Dapr annotations
- invoke_method() call from todo-api
- Error handling for invocation failures
```

## Try With AI

### Prompt 1: Deploy Both Services

```
My todo-api needs to call notification-service when a todo is created.
Deploy both services with Dapr on Docker Desktop Kubernetes:
1. todo-api on port 8000 with app-id "todo-api"
2. notification-service on port 8001 with app-id "notification-service"
3. Show me the invoke_method() call from todo-api to notification-service
```

**What you're learning:** The complete service invocation pattern from deployment through code. You're seeing how annotations enable discovery and how one line of Python replaces pages of service mesh configuration.

### Prompt 2: Understand Automatic mTLS

```
How does Dapr handle mTLS between services? Do I need to configure
certificates for todo-api to call notification-service securely?

Walk me through what Sentry does when I deploy a new service.
```

**What you're learning:** How Dapr eliminates certificate management from your concerns. Sentry acts as an automated Certificate Authority, issuing short-lived certificates to each sidecar. You get encrypted service-to-service traffic without writing TLS code or managing cert rotation.

### Prompt 3: Debug Wrong app-id

```
My invoke_method() call fails with:
"ERR_DIRECT_INVOKE: app-id notification-service not found"

But kubectl get pods shows notification-service running. What should
I check? Show me how to debug step by step.
```

**What you're learning:** Systematic debugging of service invocation. The pod running doesn't mean the Dapr sidecar is healthy or that the app-id matches. You'll learn to verify sidecar injection (2/2 Ready), check annotation spelling, and use `dapr logs` to trace the invocation path.

**Safety note:** When testing service invocation between different namespaces, ensure Dapr's namespace scoping is configured correctly. By default, services can only invoke within the same namespace unless you explicitly configure cross-namespace access.
