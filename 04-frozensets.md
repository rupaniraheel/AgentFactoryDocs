# Frozensets: Immutable Sets for Hashable Contexts

In Lesson 3, you discovered that sets are blazingly fast because they use **hashing** — storing elements based on computed integer values. But there was a catch: elements must be **immutable** because their hash values must never change.

This lesson introduces **frozensets** — the immutable sibling of the mutable `set`. A frozenset is a set that can't be modified after creation. This simple constraint unlocks powerful capabilities: **frozensets can be dictionary keys. Frozensets can be members of other sets. Frozensets can be used anywhere immutability is required.**

By the end of this lesson, you'll understand when frozensets are necessary and how they enable designs that regular sets can't achieve.

---

## Concept: Frozenset as Immutable Set

A **frozenset** is created using the `frozenset()` constructor. Unlike sets, frozensets cannot be modified after creation — no `.add()`, `.remove()`, or `.discard()` methods exist.

The trade-off is deliberate:

- **Set (mutable)**: Can add/remove elements anytime; cannot be dict keys; cannot be in sets
- **Frozenset (immutable)**: Cannot change after creation; CAN be dict keys; CAN be in sets

Here's how to create frozensets:

```python
# Create from a list
coordinates: frozenset[int] = frozenset([1, 2, 3])
print(coordinates)  # frozenset({1, 2, 3})

# Create from another set
my_set: set[str] = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
frozen: frozenset[str] = frozenset(my_set)
print(frozen)  # frozenset({'apple', 'banana', 'cherry'})

# Create empty frozenset
empty: frozenset[int] = frozenset()
print(empty)  # frozenset()

# Verify it's hashable
print(f"Frozenset is hashable: {hash(coordinates)}")  # <some integer>
```

**Key Observation**: Notice the type hints: `frozenset[int]`, `frozenset[str]`. These follow the same pattern as sets, making the distinction clear to anyone reading your code.

Attempting to modify a frozenset raises an error:

```python
my_frozen: frozenset[int] = frozenset([1, 2, 3])

try:
    my_frozen.add(4)  # ❌ Method doesn't exist
except AttributeError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")  # 'frozenset' object has no attribute 'add'

try:
    my_frozen.remove(1)  # ❌ Method doesn't exist
except AttributeError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")  # 'frozenset' object has no attribute 'remove'
```

#### 💬 AI Colearning Prompt

## Concept: Frozensets Are Hashable (The Superpower)

Because frozensets are immutable, they are **hashable**. This means you can use them in two powerful contexts:

1. **As dictionary keys**
2. **As members of sets**

Regular sets cannot do either of these. Let's see why:

### PRIMARY USE CASE: Task Statuses and Priority Levels

A real-world use case for frozensets is representing **fixed, immutable lists of valid values**. For example, task status categories that never change:

```python
# Immutable priority levels - can't be changed after creation
PRIORITY_LEVELS: frozenset[str] = frozenset({"low", "medium", "high", "urgent"})

# Can use as dictionary key (hashable)
# Map each priority level set to a color for UI display
priority_colors: dict[frozenset[str], str] = {
    PRIORITY_LEVELS: "rainbow"  # Works because frozenset is hashable
}

# Task with fixed valid statuses - never changes after app startup
VALID_STATUSES: frozenset[str] = frozenset({"pending", "in_progress", "completed", "cancelled"})

# Validate user input against immutable set
def validate_task_status(status: str) -> bool:
    return status in VALID_STATUSES

# This will work
print(validate_task_status("pending"))     # True
print(validate_task_status("done"))        # False

# The immutability guarantee is crucial here - we know these valid statuses
# will never change unexpectedly within our application
```

**Why frozenset matters here**: If these were regular mutable sets, someone could accidentally modify them with `.add()` or `.remove()`, breaking validation logic throughout your app. Frozensets guarantee that `VALID_STATUSES` remains exactly as defined when the app starts.

### Frozensets as Dictionary Keys

Regular sets cannot be dictionary keys because they're mutable and unhashable:

```python
# ❌ This fails
try:
    bad_dict: dict[set[int], str] = {
        {1, 2}: "pair",
        {3, 4}: "another"
    }
except TypeError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")  # unhashable type: 'set'
```

But frozensets work perfectly as keys:

```python
# ✅ This works
user_groups: dict[frozenset[str], str] = {
    frozenset({"admin", "user"}): "Full access",
    frozenset({"user"}): "Read-only access",
    frozenset({"guest"}): "Public access"
}

# Lookup by frozenset key
admin_access: str = user_groups[frozenset({"admin", "user"})]
print(f"Admin group access: {admin_access}")  # Full access
```

**Real-World Use Case: Permission System**

Imagine a permission system where user roles determine access level:

```python
# Define permission tiers as frozenset keys
permission_levels: dict[frozenset[str], str] = {
    frozenset({"admin"}): "Can do everything",
    frozenset({"admin", "moderator"}): "Can moderate and administer",
    frozenset({"moderator"}): "Can moderate content",
    frozenset({"user"}): "Can read and comment",
    frozenset({"guest"}): "Can read only"
}

# Check user permissions
def get_access_level(user_roles: frozenset[str]) -> str:
    return permission_levels.get(user_roles, "Undefined access level")

alice_roles: frozenset[str] = frozenset({"admin", "moderator"})
print(get_access_level(alice_roles))  # Can moderate and administer
```

This pattern is elegant: the user's role set IS the key. No separate lookups needed.

---

## Concept: Nesting Frozensets in Sets

Regular sets cannot contain sets (because sets aren't hashable). But they can contain frozensets:

```python
# ❌ This fails
try:
    nested_sets: set[set[int]] = {{1, 2}, {3, 4}}
except TypeError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")  # unhashable type: 'set'

# ✅ This works
teams: set[frozenset[str]] = {
    frozenset({"Alice", "Bob"}),
    frozenset({"Bob", "Charlie"}),
    frozenset({"Alice", "Charlie"})
}

print(f"All teams: {teams}")
# All teams: {frozenset({'Alice', 'Bob'}), frozenset({'Bob', 'Charlie'}), frozenset({'Alice', 'Charlie'})}
```

**Real-World Use Case: Finding All Team Members**

```python
# Find all unique members across all teams
teams: set[frozenset[str]] = {
    frozenset({"Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"}),
    frozenset({"David", "Eve"}),
    frozenset({"Frank", "Alice"})
}

all_members: set[str] = set()
for team in teams:
    all_members |= team  # Union with each team's members

print(f"All team members: {all_members}")  # {'Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'David', 'Eve', 'Frank'}
```

#### 🎓 Expert Insight
> In AI-native development, you don't memorize when to use frozenset vs. set—you recognize the constraint. When you need "a collection as a dictionary key" or "a set containing other sets," that's your signal. Ask your AI: "Can I use a regular set here or do I need frozenset?" and it'll explain the immutability requirement.

#### 🤝 Practice Exercise

> **Ask your AI**: "Create a permission system where user roles (sets of strings) are dictionary keys mapped to access levels. Use frozensets to make this work. Then try it with regular sets and show me why it fails."

**Expected Outcome:** You'll understand through hands-on experimentation why frozensets are necessary for this pattern and see the "unhashable type" error when using regular sets.

## Code Examples

### Example 1: Creating and Verifying Frozensets

**Specification**: Create frozensets from various sources, verify immutability and hashability.

**AI Prompt Used**: "Show me how to create frozensets in Python 3.14+ with type hints, and verify that they're immutable and hashable."

```python
# Create frozensets with type hints
colors: frozenset[str] = frozenset(["red", "green", "blue"])
numbers: frozenset[int] = frozenset([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
empty: frozenset[str] = frozenset()

# Verify type
print(f"Type of colors: {type(colors)}")  # <class 'frozenset'>

# Verify hashability (can get hash value)
color_hash: int = hash(colors)
print(f"Hash of frozenset: {color_hash}")  # Some integer

# Verify immutability - no modification methods
print(f"Methods available: {[m for m in dir(colors) if not m.startswith('_')]}")
# Shows: copy, difference, intersection, isdisjoint, issubset, issuperset, symmetric_difference, union

# Verify read-only operations work
union_result: frozenset[str] = colors | frozenset(["yellow"])
print(f"Union works: {union_result}")  # frozenset({'red', 'green', 'blue', 'yellow'})

# Verify assignment/modification fails
try:
    colors.add("yellow")
except AttributeError as e:
    print(f"Cannot modify frozenset: {e}")  # 'frozenset' object has no attribute 'add'
```

**Expected Output**:
```
Type of colors: <class 'frozenset'>
Hash of frozenset: -5483841318619854644
Methods available: ['copy', 'difference', 'intersection', 'isdisjoint', 'issubset', 'issuperset', 'symmetric_difference', 'union']
Union works: frozenset({'red', 'green', 'blue', 'yellow'})
Cannot modify frozenset: 'frozenset' object has no attribute 'add'
```

### Example 2: Using Frozensets as Dictionary Keys

**Specification**: Show that regular sets fail as dict keys, but frozensets work. Demonstrate practical use case.

**AI Prompt Used**: "Create a Python example showing why I can't use sets as dictionary keys but CAN use frozensets, with a realistic business scenario."

```python
# First, show the problem with regular sets
print("Attempting to use set as dictionary key:")
try:
    bad_dict: dict[set[str], int] = {
        {1, 2, 3}: 100  # ❌ Try to use set as key
    }
except TypeError as e:
    print(f"  ❌ Error: {e}")  # unhashable type: 'set'

# Now show the solution with frozensets
print("Using frozenset as dictionary key:")

# Scenario: Coordinate lookup for locations
location_coordinates: dict[frozenset[tuple[int, int]], str] = {
    frozenset([(0, 0), (1, 1)]): "diagonal_main",
    frozenset([(2, 0), (0, 2)]): "corners",
    frozenset([(5, 5)]): "center_point"
}

# Look up location by coordinate set
query: frozenset[tuple[int, int]] = frozenset([(0, 0), (1, 1)])
location: str = location_coordinates.get(query, "Unknown location")
print(f"  Location found: {location}")  # diagonal_main

# More practical: Permission levels as frozenset keys
permission_tiers: dict[frozenset[str], list[str]] = {
    frozenset(["admin"]): ["read", "write", "delete", "manage_users"],
    frozenset(["moderator"]): ["read", "write", "delete"],
    frozenset(["user"]): ["read", "write"],
    frozenset(["guest"]): ["read"]
}

# Check what a user with specific roles can do
user_bob_roles: frozenset[str] = frozenset(["user"])
bob_permissions: list[str] = permission_tiers.get(user_bob_roles, [])
print(f"  Bob's permissions: {bob_permissions}")  # ['read', 'write']
```

**Expected Output**:
```
Attempting to use set as dictionary key:
  ❌ Error: unhashable type: 'set'

Using frozenset as dictionary key:
  Location found: diagonal_main
  Bob's permissions: ['read', 'write']
```

---

### Example 3: Nesting Frozensets in Sets

**Specification**: Show that regular sets cannot be nested, but frozensets can. Demonstrate operations on nested structures.

**AI Prompt Used**: "Show me how to create a set of frozensets and perform operations on nested frozenset structures."

```python
# Show the problem with nested sets
print("Attempting to nest sets:")
try:
    nested_sets: set[set[int]] = {{1, 2}, {3, 4}}
except TypeError as e:
    print(f"  ❌ Error: {e}")  # unhashable type: 'set'

# Solution: Use frozensets
print("Nesting frozensets in sets:")

# Represent student groups in different clubs
clubs: set[frozenset[str]] = {
    frozenset({"Alice", "Bob"}),        # chess club
    frozenset({"Bob", "Charlie"}),      # debate club
    frozenset({"Alice", "Charlie"}),    # math club
    frozenset({"David"})                # solo club
}

print(f"Total unique groups: {len(clubs)}")  # 4

# Find all students involved in clubs
all_members: set[str] = set()
for club_members in clubs:
    all_members |= club_members

print(f"All club members: {all_members}")  # {'Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'David'}

# Find the most popular students (in multiple clubs)
member_count: dict[str, int] = {}
for club_members in clubs:
    for member in club_members:
        member_count[member] = member_count.get(member, 0) + 1

popular: [str] = [name for name, count in member_count.items() if count > 1]
print(f"Members in multiple clubs: {popular}")  # ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie']

# Find which students are in the same clubs
alice_clubs: set[frozenset[str]] = {club for club in clubs if "Alice" in club}
bob_clubs: set[frozenset[str]] = {club for club in clubs if "Bob" in club}

# Do they share any clubs?
shared: set[frozenset[str]] = alice_clubs & bob_clubs
print(f"Alice and Bob are in {len(shared)} club(s) together")  # 1
```

**Expected Output**:
```
Attempting to nest sets:
  ❌ Error: unhashable type: 'set'

Nesting frozensets in sets:
Total unique groups: 4
All club members: {'Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'David'}
Members in multiple clubs: ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie']
Alice and Bob are in 1 club(s) together
```

## Practice Exercises

**Exercise 1: Create a Frozenset and Verify Hashability**

Create a frozenset containing 5 integers, then:
- Print it with proper type hint syntax
- Verify it's hashable by computing its hash value
- Try to add an element (expect an error)

**Exercise 2: Dictionary Keys with Frozensets**

Create a dictionary where the keys are frozensets representing permission levels. Each value should be a list of allowed actions. Implement a lookup function that takes a frozenset of roles and returns the corresponding actions.

**Exercise 3: Nesting Frozensets in Sets**

Create a set of frozensets representing groups of students. Then:
- Find the total number of unique students
- Find which students appear in multiple groups
- Find if two specific students share any groups

**Exercise 4: Convert Between Set and Frozenset**

Create a mutable set, convert it to a frozenset, then convert it back to a set. Verify that the conversion preserves elements and doesn't have a performance penalty.
