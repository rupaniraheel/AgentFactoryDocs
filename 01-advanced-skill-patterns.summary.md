### Core Concept
Execution skills orchestrate code autonomously, unlike advisory skills that recommend. The persona describes the workflow the skill manages. Decision-making questions encode when/how/whether to act. Principles constrain behavior with explicit boundaries.

### Key Mental Models
- **Advisory vs execution**: "You are an expert" → recommends; "You are an orchestrator: watch, do, analyze, iterate" → acts
- **Three question types**: Context analysis (what's the situation?), Convergence (when stop?), Safety (what NOT to do?)
- **Principle structure**: Constraint + Reason + Application = testable behavioral guideline
- **Layer 3 vs Layer 4**: L3 = reusable pattern (3+ projects); L4 = customer-specific Digital FTE

### Critical Patterns
- Execution persona template: "You are a [domain] orchestrator: When you see [situation], (1) [action], (2) [action], (3) [validate], (4) [iterate or complete]"
- Question anti-patterns: "Is this important?" = vague; "Does output match spec completely?" = actionable
- Principle categories: Convergence (when done), Efficiency (minimize waste), Safety (what never happens)
- Skill composition: Sequential, conditional, or referenced dependencies

### AI Collaboration Keys
- Persona drives all decision-making—design it carefully
- Questions must be answerable from context, not vague
- Principles prevent runaway execution and constrain autonomous behavior

### Common Mistakes
- Writing vague personas that activate recommendation instead of execution
- Questions that can't be answered from the problem context
- Missing convergence principles (leads to infinite iteration)
