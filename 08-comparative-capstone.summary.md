### Core Concept
There's no universal "best" AI-native IDE. Zed prioritizes speed through inline workflows, Cursor balances autonomy with control via specification-first diffs, and Antigravity emphasizes planning through artifact-based development. Choose based on project complexity and your thinking style.

### Key Mental Models
- **Workflow → Thinking Style**: Your IDE shapes cognition—Zed encourages incremental building, Cursor drives specification-driven thinking, Antigravity promotes architectural planning
- **Project-Tool Match**: Quick prototypes → Zed (inline, fast iteration); medium features → Cursor (agent autonomy with review); complex systems → Antigravity (plan artifacts, team coordination)
- **Planning Investment Payoff**: Upfront planning seems slower but prevents wrong implementations—Cursor and Antigravity reduce total iteration cycles on complex projects

### Critical Patterns
- Evaluate IDEs across five dimensions: development speed, code quality, learning curve, autonomy level, testing/iteration experience
- Decision framework questions: Do I need upfront planning? Agent autonomy? Multi-file context awareness? Test strategy visibility?
- Build personal strategy: Primary IDE for 70% of work, Secondary for specific use cases, Tertiary for edge cases
- Scenario matching: Bug fixes → Zed; refactoring existing code → Cursor (diff control); new security-critical components → Antigravity (plan review)

### Common Mistakes
- Choosing IDE based on feature lists rather than workflow fit—the "best" depends entirely on project context and personal thinking style
- Using one tool for all projects—experienced developers switch IDEs based on task complexity and planning requirements
- Undervaluing planning phases—specification review (Cursor) and plan artifacts (Antigravity) feel slower but prevent costly wrong implementations
- Assuming faster initial response means faster completion—tight feedback loops (Zed) work for simple tasks but complex projects benefit from upfront design
