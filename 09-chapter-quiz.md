  questions={[
    {
      question: "What problem does MCP fundamentally solve? (Lesson 1)",
      options: [
        "Making AI models run faster and cheaper",
        "Tool schema fragmentation—enabling one tool definition to work across multiple AI platforms",
        "Replacing the need for APIs in modern applications",
        "Simplifying natural language processing for chatbots"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "MCP's core purpose is to solve SDK tool fragmentation. Before MCP, you had to define tools three times (OpenAI, Claude, Google SDKs). MCP provides one universal standard so you define a tool once and every MCP-compatible platform can use it instantly.",
      source: "Lesson 1: MCP Architecture Overview"
    },
    {
      question: "In MCP's Host-Client-Server architecture, which component decides when to invoke tools? (Lesson 1)",
      options: [
        "The Host (your IDE or application)",
        "The Client (the SDK connecting to your application)",
        "The Server (where tools are defined)",
        "The LLM/AI Model (Claude, GPT-4, etc.)"
      ],
      correctOption: 3,
      explanation: "Tools are model-controlled, meaning the AI model (Claude Code, ChatGPT, etc.) decides when and how to invoke them. The server defines what tools are available; the model discovers them and decides autonomously when to use each one. This is fundamentally different from SDK usage where you (the developer) control tool availability.",
      source: "Lesson 1: MCP Architecture Overview"
    },
    {
      question: "When would you choose stdio transport over HTTP transport for MCP? (Lesson 2)",
      options: [
        "Always use HTTP—it's more robust and modern",
        "Local development environments where the server runs as a subprocess on your machine",
        "Only when your MCP server has no network capability",
        "HTTP is for testing; stdio is for production"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "stdio transport is ideal for local, single-client scenarios like development environments. When your MCP server is a local subprocess (like the GitHub MCP server running on your machine), stdio provides efficient subprocess communication. HTTP/SSE is reserved for remote servers and multi-client production scenarios.",
      source: "Lesson 2: Transport Layers"
    },
    {
      question: "Why must log messages go to stderr rather than stdout in an MCP server using stdio transport? (Lesson 2)",
      options: [
        "It's a convention with no technical reason",
        "To prevent log output from interfering with JSON-RPC messages that use stdout",
        "stderr is always written to terminal while stdout is buffered",
        "To make debugging easier for developers"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "In stdio transport, JSON-RPC messages flow exclusively through stdout, and the MCP client reads from that stream. If your server writes logs to stdout, they'll be interpreted as part of the message stream, breaking the protocol. Logs must go to stderr (which isn't read by the client) to keep the stdout channel pure for protocol messages.",
      source: "Lesson 2: Transport Layers"
    },
    {
      question: "What is the key difference between tools/list and tools/call in MCP? (Lesson 3)",
      options: [
        "tools/list and tools/call are the same operation with different names",
        "tools/list discovers available tools; tools/call invokes a specific tool with parameters",
        "tools/list is for human users; tools/call is for AI models",
        "tools/call caches results; tools/list always fetches fresh data"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "tools/list is the discovery operation—the server broadcasts all available tools and their schemas. tools/call is the invocation operation—the model sends a request to execute a specific tool with given parameters. A complete tool interaction requires both: first discovering what's available (tools/list), then deciding to use one (tools/call).",
      source: "Lesson 3: Tools—The Model-Controlled Primitive"
    },
    {
      question: "In the control model comparison, which primitive allows the APPLICATION to decide when data is exposed? (Lesson 4)",
      options: [
        "Tools (model-controlled)",
        "Prompts (user-controlled)",
        "Resources (app-controlled)",
        "All three use app-controlled exposure"
      ],
      correctOption: 2,
      explanation: "Resources are app-controlled. The application decides when to expose data to the model. Tools are model-controlled (AI decides when to use them), and prompts are user-controlled (the human decides when to apply them). This distinction is crucial: resources let applications protect sensitive data by controlling exposure timing.",
      source: "Lesson 4: Resources—The App-Controlled Primitive"
    },
    {
      question: "When the application needs to control when data is accessed, which MCP primitive should you use? (Lesson 4)",
      options: [
        "Tools—because they are the most flexible primitive",
        "Resources—because they are app-controlled and let the application decide when to expose data",
        "Prompts—because they are designed for data access patterns",
        "Any of the above work equally well for app-controlled access"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "Resources are the correct primitive when the application needs to control data access. Tools are model-controlled (the AI decides when to use them), while Resources are app-controlled (the application decides when to expose data). This distinction matters for security—Resources let you protect sensitive data by controlling exposure timing.",
      source: "Lesson 4: Resources—The App-Controlled Primitive"
    },
    {
      question: "What makes MCP prompts fundamentally different from Tool definitions? (Lesson 5)",
      options: [
        "Prompts are just rebranded tools with different naming",
        "Prompts encode domain expertise into reusable instruction templates that USERS select; tools are actions that MODELS autonomously invoke",
        "Prompts run faster than tools",
        "Prompts can only be used in ChatGPT; tools are for all platforms"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "Prompts are expert-crafted instruction templates that users select when needed. They capture tacit knowledge about problem-solving (like 'code review' or 'legal contract analysis'). Tools are different: they're capabilities the model autonomously invokes. This three-way split (tools=model-controlled, resources=app-controlled, prompts=user-controlled) represents MCP's architectural elegance.",
      source: "Lesson 5: Prompts—The User-Controlled Primitive"
    },
    {
      question: "Where should MCP client configuration files typically be stored? (Lesson 6)",
      options: [
        "In the root directory of your project",
        "Always in a single global ~/.config directory regardless of use case",
        "In ~/.config/claude (for Claude Code) or ~/user/Library/Application Support (for Cursor on macOS)",
        "Configuration files aren't necessary for basic MCP usage"
      ],
      correctOption: 2,
      explanation: "MCP client configuration goes in client-specific locations: Claude Code uses ~/.config/claude on Unix/Linux or ~/Library/Application Support/Claude on macOS; Cursor uses similar paths in its config directory. The location depends on the client application, not on your project structure.",
      source: "Lesson 6: Configuring MCP Clients"
    },
    {
      question: "What is the correct syntax for environment variable substitution in MCP configuration? (Lesson 6)",
      options: [
        "$VARIABLE_NAME",
        "%VARIABLE_NAME%",
        "${VARIABLE_NAME}",
        "env.VARIABLE_NAME"
      ],
      correctOption: 2,
      explanation: "MCP configuration uses ${VARIABLE_NAME} syntax for environment variable substitution. This allows configuration files to reference secrets and deployment-specific values without hardcoding them, supporting ${HOME}, ${MCP_SERVER_KEY}, and other environment variables.",
      source: "Lesson 6: Configuring MCP Clients"
    },
    {
      question: "How should you evaluate an MCP server from the community before using it? (Lesson 7)",
      options: [
        "If it exists, it's automatically safe and high-quality",
        "Check source code quality, maintenance status, permissions requested, security audit status, and community adoption",
        "Use whichever server has the most GitHub stars",
        "Evaluation isn't necessary—MCP servers can't access sensitive data"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "Community MCP servers vary significantly in quality and safety. You should evaluate: source code transparency and quality, maintenance activity (recent commits), permissions requested (what access does it need?), any security audits performed, and adoption by trusted organizations. A well-maintained server from Anthropic or popular open-source projects is more trustworthy than an unmaintained server with unknown authors.",
      source: "Lesson 7: Using Community MCP Servers"
    },
    {
      question: "When combining multiple MCP servers (like GitHub + Filesystem + Database servers), which principle is MOST important? (Lesson 7)",
      options: [
        "Use as many servers as possible for maximum capability",
        "Each server should have minimal overlap in functionality to avoid conflicts",
        "Carefully manage permissions and tool naming to prevent security issues and command ambiguity",
        "All servers must use the same programming language"
      ],
      correctOption: 2,
      explanation: "When combining multiple MCP servers, you must carefully manage permissions (does the GitHub server need full repo access or read-only?), naming conventions (what if two servers define a 'list_files' tool?), and security boundaries. Each server runs in its own process, but shared names or permissions can create conflicts or security vulnerabilities.",
      source: "Lesson 7: Using Community MCP Servers"
    },
    {
      question: "What is the primary purpose of MCP Inspector? (Lesson 8)",
      options: [
        "It's a linting tool to check MCP server code quality",
        "It validates MCP server implementations against the specification",
        "It's a debugging tool for tracing message flow between client and server, inspecting tool schemas, and testing tool invocations",
        "It encrypts MCP communications for security"
      ],
      correctOption: 2,
      explanation: "MCP Inspector is a diagnostic tool for debugging MCP connections. It lets you trace JSON-RPC messages as they flow between client and server, inspect tool/resource/prompt schemas before execution, test tool invocations with custom parameters, and identify where communication breaks down. Essential for troubleshooting MCP setup.",
      source: "Lesson 8: Debugging & Troubleshooting"
    },
    {
      question: "Select ALL that are common MCP error patterns: (Lesson 8)",
      options: [
        "Log messages mixed into stdout breaking the JSON-RPC stream (stdio transport)",
        "Environment variables not resolved in configuration (${VARIABLE_NAME} stays literal)",
        "Server process crashes silently because stderr isn't monitored during setup",
        "The MCP protocol itself has critical security flaws requiring patches"
      ],
      correctOption: [0, 1, 2],
      explanation: "The first three are common debugging scenarios: (1) logs to stdout corrupting the message stream is a frequent stdio transport mistake, (2) environment variable substitution failures when config references variables that aren't set, (3) server crashes going unnoticed because developers don't monitor server process health. The protocol itself is sound—setup and configuration errors are the most frequent causes of failures.",
      source: "Lesson 8: Debugging & Troubleshooting"
    },
    {
      question: "According to the chapter, when was MCP released and what milestone demonstrates its adoption? (Lesson 1)",
      options: [
        "Released in January 2024; still waiting for major platform adoption",
        "Released November 2024 by Anthropic; adopted by OpenAI in March 2025, becoming de facto standard",
        "Released in 2023; adoption remains experimental",
        "No specific release date mentioned; adoption varies by region"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "MCP was released by Anthropic in November 2024 and rapidly adopted by OpenAI (March 2025). This timeline demonstrates remarkable ecosystem convergence—competing LLM companies standardizing on a single protocol within months. By 2025, MCP is the de facto standard for agent-tool integration.",

## Scoring Guide

**14-15 correct:** Mastery - You understand MCP architecture, control models, deployment patterns, and debugging. Ready for Chapter 38 (Building MCP Servers).

**12-13 correct:** Proficient - Solid grasp of core concepts. Review any missed lessons before building servers. Focus areas: control model distinction (tools/resources/prompts) and configuration syntax.

**10-11 correct:** Competent - Foundation is solid, but some details need reinforcement. Review lessons on: transport layer choice, environment variable syntax, or server evaluation criteria. Practice configuring an MCP server before Chapter 38.

**Below 10:** Review Recommended - Core concepts need strengthening. Start with Lesson 1 (architecture overview) and Lesson 3 (the three control models). These form the foundation for everything else.

## Next Steps

- If you scored 12+: Proceed to Chapter 38 (Building MCP Servers with FastMCP)
- If you scored 10-11: Complete one practice exercise from Lesson 6 (configure an existing MCP server) or Lesson 7 (evaluate and use a community server), then revisit Chapter 38
- If you scored below 10: Review the "differentiation—remedial" sections in lessons that you found challenging, then re-attempt this quiz
