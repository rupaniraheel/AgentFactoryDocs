# Enabling Kubernetes (Docker Desktop)

You already have Docker Desktop from Chapter 49. Here's the good news: Kubernetes is built in. No separate installation, no virtual machines, no complex setup. Just a checkbox.

By the end of this lesson, you'll have a working Kubernetes cluster running on your laptop—the same API and concepts used in production cloud deployments—ready for your first Pod deployment.

---

## Docker Desktop Kubernetes vs Cloud Kubernetes

| Feature | Docker Desktop | Cloud Kubernetes (GKE, EKS, AKS) |
|---------|----------------|----------------------------------|
| **Location** | Your laptop | Cloud data center |
| **Nodes** | Single node | Multiple nodes |
| **Cost** | Free | Cloud compute bills |
| **Setup** | One checkbox | Cloud provider configuration |
| **API** | Identical Kubernetes API | Same API |
| **kubectl** | Same commands | Same commands |

**Key insight**: Docker Desktop Kubernetes is NOT a toy. It's a real Kubernetes cluster with the same API as production. Everything you learn here transfers directly to cloud deployments.

---

## Enable Kubernetes

### Step 1: Open Docker Desktop Settings

::::os-tabs

::macos
Click the Docker icon in your menu bar → **Settings** (or press `⌘,`)

::windows
Right-click the Docker icon in the system tray → **Settings**

::linux
Click the Docker Desktop icon → **Settings**

::::

### Step 2: Enable Kubernetes

1. In Settings, click **Kubernetes** in the left sidebar
2. Check **Enable Kubernetes**
3. Click **Apply & Restart**

Docker Desktop will download Kubernetes components and start the cluster. This takes 2-3 minutes on first enable.

**What you'll see**:
- A progress indicator while Kubernetes initializes
- Docker Desktop restarts
- A green "Kubernetes running" indicator in the bottom-left corner

### Step 3: Verify Kubernetes is Running

Open a terminal and run:

```bash
kubectl version
```

**Output**:
```
Client Version: v1.28.2
Kustomize Version: v5.0.4-0.20230601165947-6ce0bf390ce3
Server Version: v1.28.2
```

Both Client and Server versions should display. If Server Version is missing, Kubernetes isn't running yet—wait for the green indicator in Docker Desktop.

---

## Verify Your Cluster

Check that your cluster is healthy:

```bash
kubectl cluster-info
```

**Output**:
```
Kubernetes control plane is running at https://kubernetes.docker.internal:6443
CoreDNS is running at https://kubernetes.docker.internal:6443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns:dns/proxy

To further debug and diagnose cluster problems, use 'kubectl cluster-info dump'.
```

This shows:
- **Control plane**: API server is running
- **CoreDNS**: Service discovery is working (pods can find each other by name)

Check the nodes in your cluster:

```bash
kubectl get nodes
```

**Output**:
```
NAME             STATUS   ROLES           AGE   VERSION
docker-desktop   Ready    control-plane   5m    v1.28.2
```

This shows:
- **NAME**: Your single node is called "docker-desktop"
- **STATUS**: Ready (healthy, accepting workloads)
- **ROLES**: control-plane (runs both control plane and worker responsibilities)
- **VERSION**: Kubernetes v1.28.2

Your Kubernetes cluster is running and ready.

## Understanding kubectl Context

kubectl needs to know which Kubernetes cluster to talk to. This is managed through **contexts**.

### What is a Context?

A context combines:
- **Cluster**: Which Kubernetes cluster to talk to
- **User**: What credentials to use
- **Namespace**: Which namespace to use (default is `default`)

### Check Your Current Context

```bash
kubectl config current-context
```

**Output**:
```
docker-desktop
```

This confirms kubectl is pointing to your Docker Desktop Kubernetes cluster.

### View All Contexts

```bash
kubectl config get-contexts
```

**Output**:
```
CURRENT   NAME             CLUSTER          AUTHINFO         NAMESPACE
*         docker-desktop   docker-desktop   docker-desktop
```

The `*` marks your current context. If you later work with cloud clusters (GKE, EKS, AKS), you'll see multiple contexts here and can switch between them:

```bash
kubectl config use-context docker-desktop
```

### Where is This Stored?

Context configuration lives in `~/.kube/config`:

```bash
cat ~/.kube/config
```

**Output** (partial):
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
clusters:
- cluster:
    certificate-authority-data: LS0tLS1...
    server: https://kubernetes.docker.internal:6443
  name: docker-desktop
contexts:
- context:
    cluster: docker-desktop
    user: docker-desktop
  name: docker-desktop
current-context: docker-desktop
kind: Config
users:
- name: docker-desktop
  user:
    client-certificate-data: LS0tLS1...
    client-key-data: LS0tLS1...
```

Docker Desktop automatically configures this when you enable Kubernetes.

## Quick Reference: Cluster Management

### Check Kubernetes Status

Look for the green "Kubernetes running" indicator in Docker Desktop's bottom-left corner. Or run:

```bash
kubectl get nodes
```

### Restart Kubernetes

If Kubernetes becomes unresponsive:
1. Docker Desktop Settings → Kubernetes
2. Click **Reset Kubernetes Cluster**

This resets the cluster to a clean state (removes all deployments).

### Disable Kubernetes

To free up resources when not using Kubernetes:
1. Docker Desktop Settings → Kubernetes
2. Uncheck **Enable Kubernetes**
3. Click **Apply & Restart**

Re-enable anytime with the same checkbox.

### Resource Allocation

Docker Desktop shares resources with Kubernetes. Adjust in:
- Docker Desktop Settings → Resources
- Recommended: At least 4GB memory for Kubernetes workloads

---

## What You've Accomplished

You now have:

- ✅ Kubernetes enabled in Docker Desktop
- ✅ kubectl configured and communicating with your cluster
- ✅ A working single-node Kubernetes cluster (same API as production)
- ✅ Understanding of kubectl contexts

No VMs. No drivers. No hypervisors. Just a checkbox.

Your local Kubernetes cluster is ready. Next lesson, you'll deploy your first Pod to this cluster.

---

## Try With AI

Now that your cluster is running, explore it with AI assistance.

### Prompt 1: Cluster Architecture

```
I just enabled Kubernetes in Docker Desktop. When I run 'kubectl get nodes',
I see 'docker-desktop' with role 'control-plane'.

In the previous lesson, you explained that production Kubernetes has separate
control plane and worker nodes. How does Docker Desktop handle this with a
single node? What components are running?
```

**What you're learning**: How Docker Desktop combines control plane and worker responsibilities on a single node, and what Kubernetes components are actually running.

### Prompt 2: Context Management

```
I want to understand kubectl contexts better. I ran 'kubectl config get-contexts'
and see 'docker-desktop'.

If I later add a cloud cluster (like GKE), how would I:
1. Add the new context?
2. Switch between local and cloud clusters?
3. Avoid accidentally deploying to production?
```

**What you're learning**: How professionals manage multiple Kubernetes environments safely, preventing accidental production deployments.

### Prompt 3: Resource Planning

```
I'm about to deploy AI agents to my Docker Desktop Kubernetes cluster.
My laptop has 16GB RAM and Docker Desktop is allocated 8GB.

How much of that 8GB is available for my workloads? What happens if my
pods request more memory than available? How should I plan resource
requests for AI workloads?
```

**What you're learning**: Resource management fundamentals—the relationship between node capacity, allocatable resources, and pod requests/limits that you'll configure in later lessons.

## Reflect on Your Skill

You built a `kubernetes-deployment` skill in Lesson 0. Test and improve it based on what you learned.

### Test Your Skill

```
Using my kubernetes-deployment skill, verify Kubernetes cluster health.
Does my skill include commands like kubectl cluster-info and kubectl get nodes?
```

### Identify Gaps

Ask yourself:
- Did my skill include kubectl context management?
- Did it explain how to verify metrics-server and cluster components are running?
- Did it cover the kubeconfig file and context switching?

### Improve Your Skill

If you found gaps:

```
My kubernetes-deployment skill is missing cluster verification and context management commands.
Update it to include kubectl cluster-info, kubectl get nodes, kubectl config current-context, and kubeconfig management.
```
