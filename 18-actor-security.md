# Actor Security Essentials

Your TaskActor is working beautifully. It persists conversation history, fires deadline reminders, and scales across your Kubernetes cluster. Then your security team asks the questions that keep production systems trustworthy: "Is the state encrypted at rest? How do we know actor-to-actor calls are secured? Who accessed which actor and when?"

These aren't theoretical concerns. In November 2024, a misconfigured Redis instance exposed 1.1 million customer records because state wasn't encrypted and access wasn't logged. The organization had built sophisticated business logic but overlooked fundamental security controls.

Dapr provides the building blocks for zero-trust actor security, but they require configuration and verification. This lesson transforms your development-ready actors into production-hardened systems that security teams can approve.

## The Actor Threat Model

Before configuring security controls, you need to understand what you're protecting against. Actors have a specific threat surface that differs from traditional microservices.

### Where Sensitive Data Lives

| Location | Exposure Risk | Mitigation |
|----------|---------------|------------|
| **State Store** | Database administrator access, backup exposure, storage breach | State encryption at rest |
| **Network Transit** | Man-in-the-middle, packet sniffing, compromised network | mTLS encryption |
| **Application Logs** | Log aggregator access, debug output leaks | Structured audit logging (sanitized) |
| **Memory** | Container escape, memory dump | Process isolation, secrets management |

### Actor-Specific Threats

Actors introduce unique considerations beyond typical microservice security:

**Identity-Based Attacks**: Each actor has a unique ID (e.g., `TaskActor/task-123`). An attacker who learns your ID scheme can attempt to invoke arbitrary actors.

**State Poisoning**: Unlike stateless services, actors persist state. Compromised state affects all future interactions with that actor.

**Reminder/Timer Manipulation**: If an attacker can register reminders, they can trigger actor methods at will.

**Placement Service Trust**: The placement service routes actor calls. A compromised placement service could redirect traffic.

## State Encryption Configuration

Dapr doesn't encrypt state by default. Your actor state sits in Redis (or your configured store) in plaintext. Anyone with database access can read it.

### Understanding the Encryption Model

Dapr implements **client-side encryption** using AES in Galois/Counter Mode (GCM). This means:

- Encryption happens in the Dapr sidecar, before data reaches the state store
- The state store never sees plaintext data
- You control the encryption keys through a secrets component

Supported key sizes: 128, 192, or 256 bits. Dapr documentation recommends 128-bit keys for optimal performance with strong security.

### Generating Encryption Keys

Create a 128-bit hex-encoded encryption key:

```bash
openssl rand 16 | hexdump -v -e '/1 "%02x"'
```

**Output:**
```
a3b8c9d0e1f2a3b4c5d6e7f8a9b0c1d2
```

Store this key in a Kubernetes secret:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic actor-encryption-keys \
  --from-literal=primary-key=a3b8c9d0e1f2a3b4c5d6e7f8a9b0c1d2 \
  --namespace default
```

### Configuring the Encrypted State Store

Update your state store component to enable encryption:

```yaml
# components/statestore-encrypted.yaml
apiVersion: dapr.io/v1alpha1
kind: Component
metadata:
  name: statestore
  namespace: default
spec:
  type: state.redis
  version: v1
  metadata:
    - name: redisHost
      value: redis-master.default.svc.cluster.local:6379
    - name: redisPassword
      secretKeyRef:
        name: redis-credentials
        key: password
    # Enable actor state store
    - name: actorStateStore
      value: "true"
    # Primary encryption key (from secrets)
    - name: primaryEncryptionKey
      secretKeyRef:
        name: actor-encryption-keys
        key: primary-key
```

**Key points:**

- Encryption keys **must** come from a secrets component (never plaintext in YAML)
- The `actorStateStore: "true"` flag enables actor-specific optimizations
- Keys must be valid hex-encoded values

### Key Rotation Strategy

Production systems need key rotation. Dapr supports primary and secondary keys for zero-downtime rotation.

```yaml
metadata:
  # New primary key
  - name: primaryEncryptionKey
    secretKeyRef:
      name: actor-encryption-keys
      key: new-primary-key
  # Old primary becomes secondary
  - name: secondaryEncryptionKey
    secretKeyRef:
      name: actor-encryption-keys
      key: old-primary-key
```

**Rotation process:**

1. Generate new encryption key
2. Add new key to secrets as `new-primary-key`
3. Update component: new key as primary, old key as secondary
4. Restart pods to pick up new configuration
5. Dapr automatically identifies which key encrypted each state item
6. New writes use primary key; reads work with either key
7. After sufficient time, remove secondary key

**Important**: Data encrypted with the old key is not automatically re-encrypted. If you need full re-encryption, your application must read and write each state item.

### Verifying Encryption

Check that state is actually encrypted in Redis:

```bash
# Connect to Redis
kubectl exec -it redis-master-0 -- redis-cli

# Look at an actor state key
GET "task-actor-service||TaskActor||task-123||task_data"
```

**Without encryption (BAD):**
```
"{\"status\": \"pending\", \"title\": \"Review PR\"}"
```

**With encryption (GOOD):**
```
"\x00\x01actor-encryption-keys\x00...<binary data>..."
```

The encrypted value includes a prefix identifying which key encrypted it, enabling the rotation strategy.

## mTLS Verification

Dapr enables mTLS by default through the Sentry service. But "enabled by default" doesn't mean "working correctly." You need to verify.

### Understanding Dapr's mTLS Architecture

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    Dapr Sentry (CA)                          │
│                                                              │
│  - Issues workload certificates to sidecars                  │
│  - Manages certificate rotation                              │
│  - Validates service identities                              │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                            │
            ┌───────────────┼───────────────┐
            ▼               ▼               ▼
      ┌──────────┐    ┌──────────┐    ┌──────────┐
      │ TaskActor │    │ Worker   │    │ Notifier │
      │ Sidecar   │←──→│ Sidecar  │←──→│ Sidecar  │
      │ (cert-A)  │    │ (cert-B) │    │ (cert-C) │
      └──────────┘    └──────────┘    └──────────┘
            │               │               │
            ▼               ▼               ▼
      ┌──────────┐    ┌──────────┐    ┌──────────┐
      │ TaskActor│    │ Worker   │    │ Notifier │
      │ Service  │    │ Service  │    │ Service  │
      └──────────┘    └──────────┘    └──────────┘
```

Each sidecar gets a unique certificate from Sentry. Actor-to-actor calls (via `ActorProxy`) go through the sidecars with mutual TLS authentication.

### Verifying Sentry is Running

```bash
kubectl get pods -n dapr-system | grep sentry
```

**Expected output:**
```
dapr-sentry-7b9c8d6f5-x2kjv   1/1   Running   0   5d
```

If Sentry isn't running, mTLS is not functional.

### Checking mTLS Configuration

```bash
kubectl get configurations/daprsystem -n dapr-system -o yaml
```

Look for the mTLS section:

```yaml
spec:
  mtls:
    enabled: true
    workloadCertTTL: "24h"
    allowedClockSkew: "15m"
```

**Key settings:**

- `enabled: true` - mTLS is active
- `workloadCertTTL` - How long workload certificates are valid (default 24h)
- `allowedClockSkew` - Tolerance for time differences between nodes

### Verifying Certificate Status

Check the Sentry logs for certificate operations:

```bash
kubectl logs -n dapr-system -l app=dapr-sentry --tail=50
```

Look for:

```
level=info msg="certificate signed successfully" app_id=task-actor-service
```

**Warning signs** (30 days before root certificate expiration):

```
level=warning msg="Dapr root certificate expiration warning: certificate expires in 25 days"
```

### Certificate Rotation

Dapr self-signed certificates are valid for one year. Before expiration, rotate them:

```bash
# Using Dapr CLI (recommended)
dapr mtls renew-certificate -k --valid-until 365 --restart
```

**Critical**: Always sign new certificates with the same private root key to avoid service disruption.

## API Token Authentication

For additional defense-in-depth, configure API token authentication for actor invocations.

### Configuring API Tokens

Create a token secret:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic dapr-api-token \
  --from-literal=token=$(openssl rand -base64 32) \
  --namespace default
```

Update your deployment annotations:

```yaml
metadata:
  annotations:
    dapr.io/enabled: "true"
    dapr.io/app-id: "task-actor-service"
    dapr.io/app-port: "8000"
    # Enable API token authentication
    dapr.io/api-token-secret: "dapr-api-token"
```

### Client Configuration

Clients must include the token in requests:

```python
from dapr.clients import DaprClient

# Token is automatically read from DAPR_API_TOKEN environment variable
# Or configure explicitly:
with DaprClient() as client:
    client.invoke_actor(
        actor_type="TaskActor",
        actor_id="task-123",
        method="get_task",
        headers={"dapr-api-token": "your-token-here"}
    )
```

## Audit Logging Implementation

Security teams need to know: Who accessed which actor? When? What method did they call? What changed?

### Structured Audit Log Format

Implement audit logging in your actor methods:

```python
import logging
import json
from datetime import datetime
from dapr.actor import Actor
from dapr.actor.runtime.context import ActorRuntimeContext

# Configure structured logging
logging.basicConfig(
    format='%(message)s',
    level=logging.INFO
)
audit_logger = logging.getLogger("actor.audit")

class TaskActor(Actor, TaskActorInterface):
    def __init__(self, ctx: ActorRuntimeContext, actor_id: str):
        super().__init__(ctx, actor_id)
        self._actor_type = "TaskActor"

    def _audit_log(self, method: str, details: dict = None, caller: str = None):
        """Emit structured audit log entry."""
        log_entry = {
            "timestamp": datetime.utcnow().isoformat() + "Z",
            "event_type": "actor.method.invoked",
            "actor_type": self._actor_type,
            "actor_id": self.id.id,
            "method": method,
            "caller": caller or "unknown",
            "details": details or {}
        }
        audit_logger.info(json.dumps(log_entry))

    async def update_status(self, status: str) -> None:
        """Update task status with audit logging."""
        # Log BEFORE the operation
        self._audit_log(
            method="update_status",
            details={
                "new_status": status,
                "previous_status": await self._get_current_status()
            }
        )

        # Perform the operation
        state = await self._state_manager.get_state("task_data")
        state["status"] = status
        state["updated_at"] = datetime.utcnow().isoformat()
        await self._state_manager.set_state("task_data", state)

    async def _get_current_status(self) -> str:
        """Get current status for audit comparison."""
        found, state = await self._state_manager.try_get_state("task_data")
        return state.get("status", "unknown") if found else "not_found"
```

**Output (JSON log line):**
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-01-15T10:30:45.123Z",
  "event_type": "actor.method.invoked",
  "actor_type": "TaskActor",
  "actor_id": "task-123",
  "method": "update_status",
  "caller": "unknown",
  "details": {
    "new_status": "completed",
    "previous_status": "in_progress"
  }
}
```

### SIEM Integration Considerations

For security monitoring tools (Splunk, Elastic SIEM, Azure Sentinel):

```python
def _audit_log(self, method: str, details: dict = None, caller: str = None):
    """SIEM-ready audit log with standard fields."""
    log_entry = {
        # Standard fields for SIEM parsing
        "@timestamp": datetime.utcnow().isoformat() + "Z",
        "event.category": "process",
        "event.type": "access",
        "event.action": f"actor.{method}",
        "event.outcome": "success",  # Update on failure

        # Actor-specific context
        "actor.type": self._actor_type,
        "actor.id": self.id.id,
        "actor.method": method,

        # Request context (if available from headers)
        "source.ip": details.get("source_ip", "unknown"),
        "user.id": caller or "system",

        # Custom fields
        "custom.details": details or {}
    }
    audit_logger.info(json.dumps(log_entry))
```

### Security-Sensitive Operations

Certain operations warrant enhanced logging:

```python
async def set_deadline_reminder(self, deadline_seconds: int) -> None:
    """Register deadline reminder with security logging."""
    # Security-sensitive: reminders can trigger actor methods
    self._audit_log(
        method="set_deadline_reminder",
        details={
            "deadline_seconds": deadline_seconds,
            "security_note": "reminder_registration",
            "risk_level": "elevated"
        }
    )

    await self.register_reminder(
        reminder_name="deadline",
        state=b'{"source": "user_request"}',
        due_time=timedelta(seconds=deadline_seconds),
        period=timedelta(seconds=0)
    )
```

## Security Checklist for Production Actors

Before deploying actors to production, verify:

| Control | Verification Command | Expected Result |
|---------|---------------------|-----------------|
| Sentry running | `kubectl get pods -n dapr-system -l app=dapr-sentry` | 1/1 Running |
| mTLS enabled | `kubectl get config/daprsystem -n dapr-system -o yaml` | `mtls.enabled: true` |
| Certificate valid | Check Sentry logs for expiration warnings | No warnings |
| State encryption | Check Redis key format | Binary/encrypted data |
| Encryption keys in secrets | `kubectl get secret actor-encryption-keys` | Secret exists |
| Audit logging | Check pod logs for JSON audit entries | Structured logs present |
| API token (optional) | Verify unauthorized calls are rejected | 401 response |

:::danger Security is Non-Negotiable

Production actor deployments without security controls create real business risk:

- **Unencrypted state**: One database breach exposes all customer data
- **Missing mTLS**: Network attackers can intercept actor communications
- **No audit logs**: Security incidents become undetectable and uninvestigable

These aren't theoretical concerns. Implement security controls before your first production deployment, not after an incident.

:::

## Reflect on Your Skill

Test your `dapr-deployment` skill with security scenarios:

**Prompt 1**: "Using my dapr-deployment skill, configure state encryption for my TaskActor with key rotation support."

Evaluate whether your skill:
- Generates valid component YAML with `secretKeyRef` (not plaintext keys)
- Includes both primary and secondary encryption key configuration
- Explains the rotation process correctly

**Prompt 2**: "How do I verify mTLS is working for actor-to-actor communication in my Kubernetes cluster?"

Evaluate whether your skill:
- Provides specific `kubectl` commands for verification
- Explains what to look for in Sentry logs
- Mentions certificate expiration monitoring

**Prompt 3**: "Generate audit logging code for my TaskActor that's suitable for SIEM integration."

Evaluate whether your skill:
- Produces JSON-structured logs (not plain text)
- Includes standard fields for SIEM parsing
- Logs security-relevant context (actor ID, method, timestamp)

## Try With AI

**Setup**: Have your TaskActor implementation and Kubernetes cluster ready.

### Prompt 1: Threat Model Analysis

```
I'm deploying TaskActors to production. The actors store task data including
assignee emails and project names. Help me analyze the threat model:
1. What data is at risk?
2. Where is it exposed?
3. What controls should I prioritize?
```

**What you're learning**: How to apply security thinking systematically to actor deployments, identifying threats before they become incidents.

### Prompt 2: Encryption Configuration

```
Help me configure state encryption for my actor state store. I need:
1. Key generation commands
2. Kubernetes secret creation
3. State store component YAML with encryption
4. Verification steps to confirm encryption is working

My state store is Redis at redis-master.default.svc.cluster.local:6379
```

**What you're learning**: The complete workflow from key generation through verification, not just isolated configuration snippets.

### Prompt 3: Production Security Audit

```
Review my actor deployment for security issues:

Deployment annotations:
  dapr.io/enabled: "true"
  dapr.io/app-id: "task-actor"
  dapr.io/app-port: "8000"

State store component:
  type: state.redis
  metadata:
    - name: redisHost
      value: redis:6379
    - name: actorStateStore
      value: "true"

What's missing? What should I add before production deployment?
```

**What you're learning**: How to conduct security reviews of actor configurations, identifying gaps between development-ready and production-ready deployments.

**Safety reminder**: Never commit encryption keys, API tokens, or certificates to version control. Use Kubernetes secrets, external secrets management (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager), or sealed secrets for all sensitive configuration.
