### Core Concept
Transform accumulated Docker knowledge into a reusable AI skill using the Persona + Questions + Principles pattern, creating organizational intelligence that applies consistently across all future projects.

### Key Mental Models
- **Pattern Worth Encoding**: Recurrence (3+ projects), complexity (5+ decisions), and organizational value determine skill investment
- **Persona as Cognitive Stance**: Not "you are an expert" but specific priorities and tradeoff resolution rules
- **Analysis Questions**: Force context-specific reasoning before generating generic solutions
- **Principles as Non-Negotiables**: Hard rules that apply regardless of context, encoding production lessons

### Critical Patterns
- Identify patterns meeting three criteria: recurrence, complexity, organizational value
- Write personas with domain, target, priorities, and tradeoff resolution
- Create 5-7 analysis questions that gather project-specific context
- Define 10+ principles organized by category (build structure, security, runtime)
- Test skills against 3+ novel scenarios to validate generalization

### AI Collaboration Keys
- Use skill structure to guide AI reasoning through analysis questions
- Evaluate existing Dockerfiles against skill principles
- Create skills for your own recurring patterns beyond Docker

### Common Mistakes
- Making skills too specific (fastapi-dockerfile vs production-dockerfile)
- Vague personas without priority ordering
- Missing analysis questions (leads to generic output)
- Principles without rationale (rules need justification)

### Connections
- **Builds on**: Lessons 1-6 (accumulated Docker patterns and decisions)
- **Leads to**: Lesson 8 (Capstone) applying the skill to real containerization
