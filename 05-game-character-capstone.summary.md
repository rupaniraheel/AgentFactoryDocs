### Core Concept

Integration of Lessons 1-4 via AI collaboration. Plan design conversationally → AI generates code → you validate against intent. This three-phase approach separates concerns: you design, AI codes, you validate. Models real workflows where architects plan/validate rather than type everything.

### Key Mental Models

**Plan-Generate-Validate**: Describe design to AI, AI implements, you check correctness. **Inheritance for Specialization**: Base `Character` (shared behavior: attack, heal) → `Player`/`Enemy` subclasses (specialized behavior). **Design for Extensibility**: Good OOP handles unplanned features (Boss, equipment, save/load).

### Critical Patterns

Base → subclass hierarchy. Properties for validation (health clamping). Methods checking state (dead can't attack). Type hints throughout. Composition for flexibility (equipment as objects). AI-generated edge case tests.

### AI Collaboration Keys

Have AI generate edge case tests. Challenge with "what if" extensions (Boss, equipment, save/load). When AI suggests composition vs inheritance, understand tradeoffs. Extract design patterns into reusable frameworks.

### Common Mistakes

Over-engineering (unneeded features). Missing edge case validation (negative health). Tight coupling (can't extend without refactoring). No edge case testing.

### Connections

Culmination of Lessons 1-4. Shows why each matters: encapsulation enables safe extension, method types organize behavior, attributes track state. Prepares for Part 2 (inheritance patterns, abstract classes). Demonstrates professional development—plan, generate, validate, extend.
