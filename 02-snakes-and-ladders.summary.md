### Core Concept
AI markets organize into four competitive layers—and success means dominating one layer (finding ladders) rather than competing across all four or fighting at the consumer level (avoiding snakes).

### Key Mental Models
- **Four-Layer Structure**: Consumer AI backbone (Layer 1) → Developer tools (Layer 2) → Vertical market agents (Layer 3) → Orchestration (Layer 4). Each layer has different economics and entry barriers.
- **Snakes vs Ladders**: Consumer layer is a "snake" (two-player war requiring billions). Vertical markets are "ladders" (shortcuts to value through specialization and incumbent integration gaps).
- **Incumbent Vulnerability**: Large incumbents (Epic, Bloomberg, Blackboard) can't respond quickly due to legacy code, regulatory burden, and organizational inertia—your agility is the advantage.

### Critical Patterns
- Avoid Layer 1 entirely: it's a two-player war (OpenAI vs Google) requiring billions in compute and marketing
- Start at Layer 2 (specialized developer tools) or Layer 3 (vertical market agents)
- Identify incumbent systems that don't talk to each other—bridging them creates Layer 3 value
- Layer choice determines monetization: Layer 3 enterprise integrations command premium subscription pricing

### Common Mistakes
- Trying to build a "better ChatGPT" (competing on consumer appeal against entrenched players)
- Ignoring that vertical dominance creates the path to orchestration (Layer 4)—you don't start at the top
- Underestimating how quickly solo developers can move compared to large incumbents with legacy constraints
