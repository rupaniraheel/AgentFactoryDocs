# Monetization Models Part 2: License & Marketplace

You've learned Subscription and Success Fee—the two most direct paths to revenue. Now we'll explore two alternative models that serve different market segments and customer psychographics.

**Model 3** serves enterprises that won't use external services.

**Model 4** serves scale plays where you reach millions through platforms.

Understanding all four models transforms your strategy from "pick one" to "assemble a portfolio."

## Model 3: License (The Enterprise Play)

**How it works:** Client pays annual fee ($5,000-50,000+) for the right to run your Digital FTE within their infrastructure.

**What you provide:**
- The agent's code, logic, and trained models (as a self-hosted option)
- Documentation for deployment
- Initial training and setup (one-time)
- Optional support contract (separate)

**What the client gets:**
- Data stays in-house (compliance requirement met)
- No dependency on you for uptime
- Ability to customize for their specific needs
- IP protection (their data never leaves their servers)

### License Economics

Let's model a healthcare use case:

**Your cost structure:**
- Development + training: $20,000 (one-time)
- Support and updates (per client): $500/month × 12 = $6,000/year
- **Total cost per client per year: $6,000**

**Your pricing:** $25,000/year (per client)

**Your margin:** $19,000/year per client (76% margin, but only after 1-year payback)

**From the hospital's perspective:**
- Running customer-facing AI (HIPAA compliance) in the cloud = liability exposure
- Running self-hosted AI agent (on their own servers) = compliant, defensible
- Cost vs. 1 full-time employee: $25,000 vs. $60,000+ (after 5 months, licensing becomes cheaper)

**Why enterprises love License:**
1. **Compliance:** Data never leaves their infrastructure (HIPAA, SOC 2, GDPR all easier)
2. **Control:** They can customize, audit, and modify the agent
3. **Independence:** If you go out of business, their system still works
4. **Scale:** They license once and deploy to 100 departments without paying you more

**Why License is hard:**
1. **Long sales cycle:** 3-6 months of vendor evaluation before deal
2. **Customization debt:** Every client wants tweaks; you're constantly supporting
3. **Support burden:** Self-hosted systems fail in ways SaaS doesn't; support costs rise
4. **Competitor risk:** Once they have your code, they could fork it or build in-house

### Case Study: Hospital Diagnostic Assistant

**Hospital system:** 400-bed hospital with 50,000 annual patient visits

**Current state:** 3 full-time nurses reviewing electronic health records (EHR) for diagnostic patterns, flagging edge cases to physicians

**Compliance challenge:** All patient data is covered under HIPAA. Any use of external AI services requires Business Associate Agreements and encryption in transit. For many hospitals, the compliance overhead makes cloud AI impractical.

**Your offer (License model):**
"We'll license our Diagnostic Assistant agent for $30,000/year. You deploy it on your internal servers. Your EHR system feeds patient data to the agent, the agent flags cases for physician review. All data stays within HIPAA-compliant infrastructure."

**Hospital's ROI:**
- Replaces 1.5 FTE positions (cost: ~$90,000 + benefits)
- Improves flagging accuracy (catches patterns humans miss)
- Maintains full HIPAA compliance
- Cost: $30,000/year (payback in 4 months)

**What happens in year 2:**
- Hospital realizes they can deploy to 3 additional wings (they license for departments)
- They negotiate multi-department license: $50,000/year for organization-wide rights
- You support them quarterly but don't need to be involved in daily operations

**This is the License model.**

## Model 4: Marketplace (The Volume Play)

**How it works:** You publish your Digital FTE on platforms (OpenAI GPT Store, Claude Community, Google Marketplace) and earn commission on usage.

**What you provide:**
- The agent (fully managed by the platform)
- Documentation and examples
- Ongoing improvements and compatibility maintenance

**What customers get:**
- Access to your Digital FTE without setup hassle
- Integrated into their preferred AI platform
- Potential for passive discovery ("featured agents")

### Marketplace Economics

Imagine you build a "Writing Assistant Agent" for content creators.

**Your cost structure:**
- Development: $8,000 (one-time)
- Maintenance and updates: $500/month
- **Monthly cost: $500**

**Marketplace pricing:** Users pay $9.99/month subscription to OpenAI

**Your cut:** 30% of subscription = $3/user/month (platform takes 70%)

**The math:**
- Need 167 paying users to break even ($500 ÷ $3)
- 1,000 users = $3,000/month revenue (6x your cost)
- 10,000 users = $30,000/month revenue (60x your cost)

**Why creators love Marketplace:**
1. **Discovery:** They find you through the platform's store
2. **No friction:** One click to add to their workflow
3. **Trust:** Platform handles payments; they don't share credit card
4. **Price transparency:** They know the cost upfront

**Why Marketplace is hard:**
1. **Discovery is brutal:** 10,000+ agents on major platforms, yours gets buried
2. **Revenue split is painful:** You keep 30%, platform keeps 70%
3. **Feature dependency:** Platform controls your agent's capabilities (you can't use new features until they support them)
4. **Churn is high:** Users try for 1 month, don't see ROI, cancel
5. **Support is distributed:** Users might contact the platform instead of you

### Case Study: Financial Forecasting Agent

**Market:** Small business owners who want to forecast cash flow but can't afford consultants

**Your agent:** Takes financial data, runs forecasting models, produces quarterly projections

**Marketplace entry:**

| Metric | Month 1 | Month 3 | Month 6 |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| Active users | 34 | 180 | 1,200 |
| Monthly churn | 60% | 50% | 40% |
| Revenue (you get 30%) | $34 | $270 | $3,600 |
| Users retained | 34 | 90 | 720 |

**Why these numbers?**
- **Month 1:** You launch, marketplace features you (honeymoon period), 34 users sign up. 60% churn (people try, don't see value, cancel)
- **Month 3:** Organic discovery kicks in (positive reviews), you improve the agent, churn improves to 50%
- **Month 6:** You've been featured twice more, word-of-mouth builds, churn improves to 40%, you reach 1,200 cumulative users with 720 retained

**Revenue at month 6:** $3,600/month. You're profitable.

**What could go wrong:**
- Marketplace features a competitor (your visibility drops)
- New feature breaks your agent (platform update incompatible with your code)
- You stop maintaining it (old reviews hurt discoverability)

## The Complete Decision Matrix: All Four Models

This is where you evaluate which model (or combination) makes sense for YOUR Digital FTE.

### Model Comparison on Five Dimensions

| Dimension | Subscription | Success Fee | License | Marketplace |
|-----------|-------------|------------|---------|-------------|
| **Revenue Potential (Year 1)** | $50K-500K | $10K-100K | $25K-250K | $5K-50K |
| **Time to Revenue** | Weeks | Months | 3-6 months | Weeks |
| **Customer Acquisition Cost** | High ($5-20K per customer) | Low ($0, risk-free) | Very High ($50K+ sales cycle) | Very Low (platform provides) |
| **Churn Risk** | High (need to stay great) | Low (success-based) | Low (sticky, compliance-driven) | Very High (easy to cancel) |
| **Support Burden** | Very High (24/7 SaaS support) | Medium (transaction-based) | Medium-High (enterprise support) | Low (platform handles support) |

### Decision Framework: Which Model(s) Should You Pursue?

**Choose Subscription if:**
- Your Digital FTE is mission-critical (customer support, sales development)
- Your customer base is predictable (SMB/mid-market)
- You have resources for customer support
- You want recurring revenue and customer relationships

**Choose Success Fee if:**
- Your Digital FTE is easy to measure (deals closed, leads qualified)
- Your customer base is skeptical ("prove it first")
- You're confident your solution works
- You want to minimize customer risk and maximize trust

**Choose License if:**
- Your customer base is enterprise
- Compliance/data sovereignty is critical (healthcare, legal, financial)
- Your market has long sales cycles
- You can support customization and self-hosted deployments

**Choose Marketplace if:**
- Your Digital FTE is consumer-facing or SMB
- Discovery through platforms is realistic
- You don't want to handle sales
- Passive income appeals to you

### Hybrid Strategies: Doing All Four

Some successful builders combine models:

**Strategy 1: Success Fee → Subscription Upgrade**
1. Start with Success Fee (prove value)
2. Upgrade best clients to Subscription (recurring revenue)
3. Result: 70% Success Fee, 30% Subscription mix

**Strategy 2: Marketplace + Subscription**
1. Launch on Marketplace (low friction, volume play)
2. Identify power users
3. Offer them Subscription (better pricing, features)
4. Result: Marketplace catches volume, Subscription catches serious buyers

**Strategy 3: Subscription + License**
1. Build SaaS Subscription for SMBs
2. License same agent to enterprises (different code path, enterprise features)
3. Result: Volume from SMBs, margin from enterprises

**Strategy 4: Marketplace → Everything**
1. Start on Marketplace (risk-free, low CAC)
2. Identify top 5% of power users
3. Pitch them upgrade to Subscription
4. For enterprise customers, offer License
5. Result: Marketplace is your acquisition funnel, other models are your monetization

## The Strategic Positioning

How you position your Digital FTE depends on which model you're selling:

### Subscription Pitch:
"Outsourced function, managed by us, recurring cost, hands-off"

### Success Fee Pitch:
"Risk-free trial, we only succeed if you succeed, alignment-based"

### License Pitch:
"Compliance-friendly, self-hosted, your data never leaves your servers, enterprise-grade"

### Marketplace Pitch:
"Integrated into your favorite platform, one-click adoption, no contracts"

## Try With AI: Design Your Revenue Model Strategy

Your challenge: Choose the optimal model(s) for your Digital FTE.

**Part 1: Answer the Four Model Questions**

For each model, answer:

**Subscription:**
- Can you support customers 24/7?
- Do you want recurring revenue and customer relationships?
- Is your customer base SMB/mid-market?

**Success Fee:**
- Can you measure success objectively?
- Are you confident in your solution's performance?
- Do your customers expect proof before payment?

**License:**
- Is your customer base enterprise?
- Are compliance/data sovereignty critical in your domain?
- Can you handle customization and self-hosted support?

**Marketplace:**
- Is your Digital FTE consumer-friendly or easy-to-adopt?
- Are you willing to accept 30% revenue split?
- Do you prefer passive discovery over active sales?

**Part 2: Ask AI for Model Recommendation**

Tell AI your domain and Digital FTE:

"I'm building a Digital FTE for [domain] that does [function].

Based on my domain:
- Are enterprises or SMBs my target customer?
- Is data sovereignty critical?
- Is success easy to measure?
- Do customers need hands-off support?

What model(s) would you recommend, and in what order?"

**Part 3: Model the Financial Projections**

For your top 2-3 models, estimate:

**By Year 1:**
- How many customers/users?
- Monthly revenue?
- What does breakeven look like?

**By Year 3:**
- If I do it right, what's the revenue ceiling?
- What would I need to hire to support this?

**Part 4: Competitive Landscape Review**

Ask AI:
"Are there competitors using [model] for similar solutions? How is their strategy working? What could I do differently?"

**Part 5: Self-Reflection**

Which model excites you most? Why?

- If Subscription: "Am I ready to be a service business?"
- If Success Fee: "Am I confident enough to put my money where my mouth is?"
- If License: "Can I handle enterprise sales cycles?"
- If Marketplace: "Can I handle discoverability challenges?"

Your answer becomes your launch strategy in Lesson 7.
