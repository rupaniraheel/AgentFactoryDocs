### Core Concept
When AI generates code reliably from specifications, the bottleneck shifts from "writing code" to "expressing intent clearly," making reusable intelligence (specifications, decision frameworks, domain expertise) the new strategic asset instead of reusable code.

### Key Mental Models
- **Paradigm shift**: From code-centric (libraries, frameworks) to intelligence-centric (specifications, decision guidance, expertise)
- **Historical evolution**: Assembly→High-level code→Specifications+AI (where specs become "source" as AI becomes "compiler")
- **Three components stack**: Specifications (WHAT) + Constitutions (universal rules) + Reusable Intelligence (HOW to decide)
- **Microservices analogy for agents**: Just as you decompose monolithic services into focused microservices, you decompose problem-solving into specialized intelligence units (Skills for horizontal patterns, Subagents for vertical expertise)

### Critical Patterns
- **Skills (Horizontal expertise)**: Broad patterns (error handling, input validation, pagination) applicable across all projects and domains
- **Subagents (Vertical specialization)**: Deep domain expertise (security auditor, performance engineer) with 5+ autonomous decisions per feature
- **Orchestration patterns**: Workflows coordinating Skills+Subagents ensuring systematic quality (specification → design review → implementation → validation)
- **Intelligence library as asset**: Organization accumulates Skills/Subagents over time, compounding productivity multiplier as library grows

### AI Collaboration Keys
- AI agents access Skill library to apply consistent patterns across features
- Subagents provide expert review (security, performance, accessibility) automatically
- Specifications+Intelligence enable AI to produce production-grade code (not just functional code)

### Common Mistakes
- Confusing Skills (guidance, 2-4 decisions) with Subagents (autonomous, 5+ decisions)
- Treating intelligence as technology-specific (Python-only) instead of platform-agnostic (spec → any language)
- Building intelligence library without organizational discipline (fragments instead of library)

### Connections
- **Builds on**: Constitution (global rules) establishes governance context
- **Leads to**: Designing Skills/Subagents with P+Q+P (how to actually create intelligence components), framework selection (choosing between Kiro/Spec-Kit/Spec-Kit Plus/Tesel)
