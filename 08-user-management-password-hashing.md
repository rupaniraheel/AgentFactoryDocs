# User Management & Password Hashing

Your API has tasks. Now it needs users. Before anyone can log in, they need an account. And before you store passwords, you need to understand why **you never store passwords**.

You store *hashes*.

## Why Password Hashing Matters

If your database leaks (and breaches happen), what does the attacker get?

| Storage Method | What Attacker Gets |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Plaintext passwords | Every password instantly. Users compromised everywhere they reused it. |
| Hashed passwords | Useless strings. Each hash must be cracked individually—expensive and slow. |

**Argon2** is the current gold standard for password hashing:
- Memory-hard (expensive to parallelize on GPUs)
- Winner of the Password Hashing Competition (2015)
- Configurable difficulty (can increase over time)

This lesson implements user signup with proper password hashing. The next lesson adds JWT authentication for login.

## Installing Dependencies

```bash
uv add pwdlib[argon2]
```

- `pwdlib` - Modern password hashing library
- `[argon2]` - Argon2 algorithm support

## Password Hashing Functions

Create `security.py`:

```python
from pwdlib import PasswordHash
from pwdlib.hashers.argon2 import Argon2Hasher

password_hash = PasswordHash((Argon2Hasher(),))


def hash_password(password: str) -> str:
    """Hash a password with Argon2."""
    return password_hash.hash(password)


def verify_password(plain_password: str, hashed_password: str) -> bool:
    """Verify a password against its hash."""
    return password_hash.verify(plain_password, hashed_password)
```

**Test it in Python:**

```python
>>> from security import hash_password, verify_password
>>> hashed = hash_password("mysecret")
>>> hashed
'$argon2id$v=19$m=65536,t=3,p=4$randomsalt$longhashstring'
>>> verify_password("mysecret", hashed)
True
>>> verify_password("wrongpassword", hashed)
False
```

Notice the hash includes algorithm parameters (`m=65536,t=3,p=4`). This means you can upgrade security settings over time without breaking existing hashes.

## User Model

Add to `models.py`:

```python
from sqlmodel import SQLModel, Field
from typing import Optional
from datetime import datetime


class User(SQLModel, table=True):
    """User account with hashed password."""
    id: Optional[int] = Field(default=None, primary_key=True)
    email: str = Field(unique=True, index=True)
    hashed_password: str
    created_at: datetime = Field(default_factory=datetime.utcnow)


class UserCreate(SQLModel):
    """Request model for user signup."""
    email: str
    password: str
```

**Key design decisions:**

| Field | Why |
|-------|-----|
| `hashed_password` | Named explicitly—never confuse with plaintext |
| `unique=True` | One account per email |
| `index=True` | Fast lookup during login |
| `UserCreate` | Separate model for requests (has `password`, not `hashed_password`) |

## Signup Endpoint

Add to `main.py`:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends, HTTPException, status
from sqlmodel import Session, select
from models import User, UserCreate
from security import hash_password
from database import get_session, create_db_and_tables

app = FastAPI(title="Task API")


@app.on_event("startup")
def on_startup():
    create_db_and_tables()


@app.post("/users/signup", status_code=201)
def signup(
    user_data: UserCreate,
    session: Session = Depends(get_session)
):
    """Create a new user account."""
    # Check if email already exists
    existing = session.exec(
        select(User).where(User.email == user_data.email)
    ).first()

    if existing:
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST,
            detail="Email already registered"
        )

    # Create user with hashed password
    user = User(
        email=user_data.email,
        hashed_password=hash_password(user_data.password)
    )

    session.add(user)
    session.commit()
    session.refresh(user)

    # Return safe fields only
    return {"id": user.id, "email": user.email}
```

**Test the endpoint:**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/users/signup \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "alice@example.com", "password": "SecurePass123"}'
```

**Output:**
```json
{"id": 1, "email": "alice@example.com"}
```

Try the same email again:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/users/signup \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "alice@example.com", "password": "DifferentPass"}'
```

**Output:**
```json
{"detail": "Email already registered"}
```

## Security Principles Applied

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|---------------|
| Never store plaintext | `hash_password()` before saving |
| Never return hashes | Response only includes `id` and `email` |
| Prevent enumeration | Duplicate check before creation |
| Use modern algorithms | Argon2id (memory-hard, GPU-resistant) |

## Hands-On Exercise

**Step 1:** Install pwdlib:

```bash
uv add pwdlib[argon2]
```

**Step 2:** Create `security.py` with hash/verify functions

**Step 3:** Add User and UserCreate models to `models.py`

**Step 4:** Add signup endpoint to `main.py`

**Step 5:** Test the flow:

```bash
# Create a user
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/users/signup \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "test@example.com", "password": "MySecure123"}'

# Verify duplicate prevention
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/users/signup \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "test@example.com", "password": "Different"}'
```

**Step 6:** Check the database—verify passwords are hashed, not plaintext

## Common Mistakes

**Mistake 1:** Storing plaintext passwords

```python
# NEVER do this
user = User(email=email, password=password)

# ALWAYS hash
user = User(email=email, hashed_password=hash_password(password))
```

**Mistake 2:** Returning the hash in responses

```python
# Wrong - exposes hash
return user

# Correct - only safe fields
return {"id": user.id, "email": user.email}
```

**Mistake 3:** Using weak hashing algorithms

```python
# Wrong - MD5 and SHA are not password hashing algorithms
import hashlib
hashed = hashlib.md5(password.encode()).hexdigest()

# Correct - use Argon2
from security import hash_password
hashed = hash_password(password)
```

**Mistake 4:** Naming the field `password` instead of `hashed_password`

```python
# Misleading - suggests it might be plaintext
class User(SQLModel, table=True):
    password: str

# Clear - obviously a hash
class User(SQLModel, table=True):
    hashed_password: str
```

## What's Next?

You have users. They can sign up. But they can't *do* anything yet—no login, no sessions, no protected routes.

The next lesson adds JWT authentication:
- Login endpoint that verifies passwords
- Token generation for authenticated sessions
- Protected routes that require tokens

## Try With AI

**Prompt 1: Password Strength Validation**

```text
I want to enforce password requirements before hashing:
- Minimum 8 characters
- At least one uppercase, one lowercase, one number

Should I validate in the Pydantic model or security.py?
Show me both approaches with tradeoffs.
```

**What you're learning:** Input validation location matters. Pydantic validates at API boundary (user-friendly errors); security module validates at hashing time (defense in depth).

**Prompt 2: Email Validation**

```text
How do I validate that emails are properly formatted before signup?
I want to reject "not-an-email" but accept "user@example.com".

Show me Pydantic EmailStr and explain when it's enough
vs when you need external validation.
```

**What you're learning:** Pydantic's `EmailStr` validates format. Real email verification requires sending a confirmation link—different problem.

**Prompt 3: Password Reset Flow**

```text
A user forgot their password. Walk me through the secure
password reset flow:
1. What endpoint do they call?
2. How do I generate a reset token?
3. How long should it be valid?
4. What happens when they use it?
```

**What you're learning:** Password reset is a common security-critical feature. Understanding the token-based flow prepares you for production systems.

## Reflect on Your Skill

You built a `fastapi-agent` skill in Lesson 0. Test and improve it based on what you learned.

### Test Your Skill

```
Using my fastapi-agent skill, help me implement user signup with password hashing.
Does my skill include Argon2 hashing with pwdlib and proper User model design?
```

### Identify Gaps

Ask yourself:
- Did my skill include password hashing with pwdlib and Argon2Hasher?
- Did it create separate User (database) and UserCreate (request) models?
- Did it check for duplicate emails before creating users?

### Improve Your Skill

If you found gaps:

```
My fastapi-agent skill is missing user management patterns.
Update it to include password hashing with pwdlib/Argon2,
User model with hashed_password field, and signup endpoint
with duplicate email prevention.
```
