# TaskManager: Complete Digital FTE Capstone

This is it. Everything you've learned in this chapter—Skills, hooks, checkpointing, cost tracking, permissions, subagents, slash commands, context management—converges into TaskManager: your first complete Digital FTE.

You're not building a feature. You're building a product. You're not writing code to learn patterns. You're writing specifications that will drive production implementation. You're not treating an agent as a tool. You're architecting it as a 24/7 employee that your customers will trust with critical workflows.

TaskManager is a Digital FTE that manages team tasks, assigns priorities, tracks completion, and generates insights. It operates autonomously with guardrails. It maintains state across sessions. It tracks its own costs. It prevents accidental data loss. It restricts dangerous operations. It logs everything for audit. It's deployable to production.

This lesson teaches you to build it specification-first.

## Understanding TaskManager: What It Does

TaskManager is a specialized agent that owns three responsibilities:

1. **Task Management**: Create, update, complete, and archive team tasks with priority levels, ownership, and deadline tracking
2. **Priority Optimization**: Analyze task dependencies and deadlines to suggest optimal execution order
3. **Team Insights**: Generate weekly reports on task completion rate, bottlenecks, and team velocity

It's the kind of agent a team might pay $199/month for subscription access to. It's the kind that improves over time as it learns team conventions. It's the kind that customers trust enough to integrate into their workflows.

### The Business Case

A typical team of 10 developers faces this problem:

- **Current state**: Uses spreadsheets or basic tools to track tasks
- **Problem**: No prioritization intelligence, no deadline awareness, manual reporting
- **Cost to solve**: Hire a project manager ($5,000-7,000/month) or spend 5 hours/week in manual coordination

TaskManager provides:
- **Autonomous task prioritization** based on dependencies and deadlines
- **Automated reporting** eliminating manual tracking
- **24/7 availability** unlike human PM

A team might save 10-15 hours/week of coordination work. At fully-loaded cost of $50/hour, that's $500-750 in value per week. A $199/month subscription is profitable for customers and sustainable for you.

## Part 1: TaskManager Complete Specification

This is where specification-driven development begins. We write the specification FIRST, before any implementation. We write it clearly enough that another developer (or an AI) could build the system without asking clarifying questions.

### System Intent

TaskManager is an autonomous agent that manages team task workflows. It integrates into development environments and Slack, maintaining persistent state across sessions. It makes decisions about task prioritization based on team conventions and business rules. It operates within strict safety guardrails that prevent data loss and require human approval for critical operations.

### Feature Requirements

| Requirement | SDK Feature | Why It Matters |
|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| Tasks persist across sessions | Session resume (session_id in query options) | Team relies on agent remembering tasks between interactions |
| Role-based permissions | canUseTool callback for permission decisions | PM can delete tasks; interns can only view |
| Safe task deletion | File checkpointing (rewindFiles) | Accidental deletion reverts without manual recovery |
| /assign, /complete, /report commands | Slash commands (.claude/commands/*.md) | Natural command interface for team members |
| Usage tracking for billing | total_cost_usd extraction and monthly aggregation | Subscription pricing requires understanding per-customer costs |
| Process multiple tasks simultaneously | Subagents for parallel task analysis | Generate report while handling new requests |
| Team conventions | Skills loaded from .claude/skills/ | Agent learns "how we do things here" from documentation |
| Long-running sessions | Context compaction strategies | Monthly operations can't run out of context |

### Success Criteria

**Task Management**
- ✓ Create task with title, description, priority (P0-P3), owner, deadline
- ✓ List tasks filtered by status (backlog, in-progress, blocked, completed)
- ✓ Update task status with reasoning logged
- ✓ Delete task with two-step approval (user confirms, agent confirms safe)
- ✓ Task history preserved (deleted tasks archived, not purged)

**Priority Optimization**
- ✓ Analyze task dependency graph
- ✓ Identify critical path (tasks blocking others)
- ✓ Suggest next task based on deadline and blockers
- ✓ Warn if task approaching deadline with no progress

**Team Insights**
- ✓ Calculate weekly completion rate (tasks completed / total assigned)
- ✓ Identify bottleneck tasks (blocking multiple others)
- ✓ Estimate velocity (tasks per developer per week)
- ✓ Generate email-ready report for stakeholders

### Constraints and Non-Goals

**Safety Constraints**
- Agent CANNOT write to config files (only task data)
- Agent CANNOT modify file permissions
- Agent CANNOT delete without human approval
- Agent CANNOT exceed 10 turns per request (cost bound)
- Agent logs all decisions for audit trail

**Non-Goals**
- NOT a time-tracking system (doesn't track hours)
- NOT a chat system (no threaded conversations)
- NOT a Kanban visualization (integrates with tools, doesn't build UI)
- NOT a calendar (uses deadlines but doesn't schedule)

### Technical Architecture

```
INPUT → PERMISSION CHECK → PROCESS → LOG → CHECKPOINT → OUTPUT
  ↓          ↓               ↓       ↓       ↓         ↓
Session → canUseTool      Task      Hooks Rewind   Result
Resume   callback         logic            safe      cost
```

**Session Management**:
- Resume from previous session using session_id
- Tasks loaded from persistent storage (task_db.json)
- Context preserved across team interactions

**Permission Layer**:
- Role check (manager > engineer > intern)
- Action validation (can this role do this action?)
- Path validation (is this a task file, not config?)

**Processing**:
- Parse task request
- Update task state
- Analyze dependencies if needed
- Execute business logic

**Logging & Safety**:
- Hooks capture all decisions
- File changes checkpointed
- Cost tracked per operation

**Output**:
- Return result to user
- Extract total_cost_usd for billing
- Prepare for next session

Your role: Make decisions about task prioritization for engineering teams.

## Decision Framework

When choosing which task is most urgent:

1. **Critical Path** (highest weight): Tasks blocking other tasks
   - If task A is blocked by task B, complete B first
   - Calculate critical path length (longest dependency chain)

2. **Deadline Proximity** (medium weight): Days until deadline
   - P0 tasks (deadline < 1 week): Execute immediately
   - P1 tasks (deadline 1-2 weeks): Schedule in next sprint
   - P2 tasks (deadline > 2 weeks): Backlog, review weekly

3. **Team Velocity** (lower weight): How fast team completes similar tasks
   - Simple tasks (< 4 hours): Do immediately if not blocked
   - Complex tasks (4-8 hours): Schedule with buffer
   - Spike tasks (> 8 hours): Break down or schedule separately

## Example Scenarios

**Scenario 1**: Two tasks, same deadline
- Task A (simple, unblocked): Do first
- Task B (complex, blocks 3 others): Then do B (for system health)

**Scenario 2**: One critical, one urgent
- Critical (deadline today): Do immediately
- Urgent (deadline tomorrow): Then do this

**Scenario 3**: New task during execution
- If new task is higher priority (closer deadline or blocking):
  Can pause current task IF not mid-critical-section
- If lower priority: Continue current task, queue new one

## What the Agent Does
1. Verify task exists
2. Check task is not already assigned to someone else
3. Verify owner exists in team roster
4. Update task assignment
5. Log assignment for audit
6. Notify owner (if integration available)

## Safety Rules
- Cannot assign if task is in 'completed' state
- Cannot assign to a team member on vacation
- Owner change requires P0 task confirmation

## Part 3: Deployment Checklist

Before shipping TaskManager to customers, validate:

### Security: Permission Model Validated

```python
# Test matrix: (role, action, expected_outcome)
tests = [
    ("intern", "delete_task", "DENY with message"),
    ("engineer", "update_task", "ALLOW"),
    ("manager", "assign_task", "ALLOW"),
    ("anyone", "write_to_config", "DENY with message"),
]

# Each test ensures permissions work correctly
for role, action, expected in tests:
    context = {"user_role": role}
    result = can_use_tool("Write" if action == "write_to_config" else "Bash",
                          {"command": "rm task.json"},
                          context)
    assert result["behavior"] == "DENY" if "DENY" in expected else "ALLOW"
```

✓ All role-based permissions tested
✓ Dangerous operations blocked
✓ Safe operations permitted

### Persistence: Session Management Validated

```python
# Session 1: Create tasks
session_1 = TaskManagerFTE("customer_123")
# Creates 3 tasks, ends session

# Session 2: Resume and verify
session_2 = TaskManagerFTE("customer_123")  # Same customer ID
# Query: "What tasks exist?"
# Should return the 3 tasks from session_1

# ✓ State persisted across sessions
```

✓ Tasks persist across sessions
✓ New team member joins mid-month, sees all history
✓ No data loss on agent restart

### Recovery: File Checkpointing Validated

```python
# Test scenario: Accidental task deletion
# 1. Create checkpoint
# 2. Delete task
# 3. Rewind to checkpoint
# 4. Verify task restored

# ✓ Agent can recover from mistakes
```

✓ Checkpointing works
✓ Rewind restores previous state
✓ Recovery is transparent to users

### Billing: Cost Tracking Integrated

```python
# Track execution costs for this customer
customer_costs = {
    "daily_status_report": 0.12,
    "weekly_analysis": 0.34,
    "priority_optimization": 0.08
}

# Monthly forecast: 30 reports + 4 analyses = (30 × 0.12) + (4 × 0.34) = $4.96
monthly_cost = (30 * 0.12) + (4 * 0.34)  # $4.96

# At $99/month subscription: margin = 97.5% ✓
```

✓ Cost tracking working
✓ Per-operation costs understood
✓ Subscription pricing covers costs with margin

### Monitoring: Hooks Configured for Audit

```python
# Hooks capture all events for monitoring:
# - on_message_start: Request logged
# - on_tool_use: Which action requested
# - on_tool_error: What failed (if anything)
# - on_tool_result: What changed
# - on_stop: Session complete

# Produces audit trail:
# 2025-01-15 14:32:05 [customer_123] Request: "Complete TASK-42"
# 2025-01-15 14:32:06 [customer_123]   → Read task_db.json
# 2025-01-15 14:32:07 [customer_123]   → Write task_db.json
# 2025-01-15 14:32:07 [customer_123] ✓ Complete (cost: $0.08)
```

✓ All operations logged
✓ Audit trail preserved
✓ Debugging information available

## Part 4: Monetization Model

TaskManager becomes a Digital FTE when you decide how to charge for it.

### Economics Foundation

| Factor | Value | Basis |
|--------|-------|-------|
| **Avg. team size** | 8 developers | Target SMB |
| **Avg. operations/month** | 240 (30/day) | 1 task per dev per day + reporting |
| **Cost per operation** | $0.08 | Typical for task processing |
| **Monthly cost per customer** | $19.20 | 240 ops × $0.08 |
| **Target margin** | 70% | Sustainable for SaaS business |
| **Break-even price** | $64 | $19.20 ÷ (1 - 0.70) |

### Model 1: Team Subscription

```python
pricing = {
    "tier_small": {
        "max_team_size": 5,
        "price_per_month": 49.00,
        "operations_per_month": 150,
        "cost_per_customer": 12.00,
        "margin_pct": 75.5
    },
    "tier_medium": {
        "max_team_size": 15,
        "price_per_month": 99.00,
        "operations_per_month": 360,
        "cost_per_customer": 28.80,
        "margin_pct": 70.9
    },
    "tier_enterprise": {
        "max_team_size": "unlimited",
        "price_per_month": 299.00,
        "operations_per_month": "unlimited",
        "cost_per_customer": "negotiate",
        "margin_pct": "custom"
    }
}

# 100 customers × $99/month = $9,900/month revenue
# @ 70% margin = $6,930 profit/month
# = $83,160/year sustainable business
```

**Pros**: Predictable revenue, simple billing
**Cons**: High-usage customers may cost more than price

### Model 2: Usage-Based + Overage

```python
pricing = {
    "base_subscription": 49.00,  # 50 operations included
    "cost_per_operation": 0.10,  # Slightly above actual cost
    "overage_price": 0.50,       # Per operation over 50

    "customer_scenarios": {
        "small_team": {
            "monthly_ops": 50,
            "cost": 49.00,
            "margin": 59.7
        },
        "medium_team": {
            "monthly_ops": 200,
            "cost": 49.00 + (150 * 0.50),
            "margin": 49.25
        },
        "power_user": {
            "monthly_ops": 500,
            "cost": 49.00 + (450 * 0.50),
            "margin": 30.1
        }
    }
}

# Average: 200 ops/month
# Average cost: $49 + (150 × $0.50) = $124
# At 70% target margin: Price = $124 ÷ 0.30 = $413
# But typical SaaS charges less and accepts lower margin for simplicity
```

**Pros**: Scales with customer usage; fair pricing
**Cons**: Cost uncertainty for customers; overage management complexity

### Model 3: Success Fee (Value-Based)

If TaskManager is solving a critical problem (e.g., reducing coordination tax):

```python
pricing = {
    "base": 0,  # Free to use
    "commission": 0.10,  # 10% of coordination time saved

    "example": {
        "team_hours_saved": 10,  # hours per week
        "hourly_rate": 75,       # fully-loaded cost
        "weekly_value": 750,     # 10 × 75
        "monthly_value": 3000,   # 750 × 4
        "commission": 300,       # 10% × 3000
        "agent_cost": 20,        # $20 to deliver value
        "margin": 93.3           # (300 - 20) / 300
    }
}

# This is highest-margin model if you can prove value
# Requires outcome tracking and customer trust
```

**Pros**: Aligned incentives, unlimited upside, customers happy (pay for value)
**Cons**: Requires outcome measurement, long sales cycle

## Part 5: Digital FTE Maturity Rubric

When is TaskManager production-ready as a Digital FTE?

| Criterion | Requirement | Status |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| **Specification Clarity** | Spec complete before code | ✓ Written in Part 1 |
| **All 8 Features** | Integrated and working | ✓ Implemented in Part 2 |
| **Safety Validated** | Permissions, checkpointing, recovery tested | ✓ Checklist in Part 3 |
| **Cost Tracked** | Per-operation and per-customer costs known | ✓ $19.20/month baseline |
| **Pricing Model** | Sustainable and defensible | ✓ $99/month w/70% margin |
| **Audit Trail** | All operations logged | ✓ Hooks configured |
| **Documentation** | Team can understand and maintain | ✓ Skills, commands, comments clear |
| **Error Recovery** | Agent can recover from failures | ✓ Checkpointing validated |
| **Performance** | Meets latency SLA | ✓ Bounded by max_turns |
| **Scalability** | Can handle 1000+ customers | ✓ Stateless processing, persistent sessions |

### Go/No-Go Decision

**GO if**: All checklist items complete AND cost/revenue math works
**NO-GO if**: Any safety validation fails OR margin < 50%

TaskManager achieves full GO status.

## Try With AI

You're going to write specifications and implementations for your own Digital FTE. Use Claude Code or Claude Agent SDK for these prompts.

### Prompt 1: Specification Writing for Your Digital FTE

```
I want to build a Digital FTE that [describe a specialized agent for your domain].

Help me write a complete specification that includes:
1. System Intent - One paragraph describing what it does
2. Feature Requirements - Table mapping business needs to SDK features
3. Success Criteria - Bullet list of measurable outcomes
4. Constraints - What it cannot do
5. Technical Architecture - Diagram or text describing the flow

Use the TaskManager spec from the lesson as a template.
My agent needs to [specific capability], and I'm not sure
how to organize the specification. Show me the structure.
```

**What you're learning**: How to think specification-first. Every production agent starts with a spec, not code. The spec drives implementation quality and reduces rework.

### Prompt 2: Integrating One New SDK Feature

```
I've built the basic agent structure. Now I need to add
[specific feature: cost tracking / file checkpointing / custom commands / etc.].

Here's my current ClaudeAgentOptions configuration: [paste code]

Show me the exact changes to add this feature. Explain:
1. What this feature does
2. How it integrates with my existing code
3. What configuration is needed
4. How to test that it works
```

**What you're learning**: Deep understanding of individual SDK features. By adding features one at a time, you build confidence and avoid complexity overload.

### Prompt 3: Monetization for Your Agent

```
My Digital FTE costs approximately [cost estimate] per execution.
My target customer does [workflow description], about [frequency] per month.

Which pricing model should I use: subscription, usage-based, or success-fee?
Help me:
1. Calculate break-even price for each model
2. Identify which has highest margin
3. Determine which feels fair to customers
4. Project annual revenue at 50 customers
```

**What you're learning**: How economics inform product design. You're not just building for technical merit—you're building a business. Cost visibility and pricing clarity are critical to sustainable Digital FTE businesses.

---

**What emerged from iteration**: A complete system that transforms domain expertise into 24/7 productivity. TaskManager manages tasks autonomously. You manage TaskManager. Customers get the benefit. Everyone wins.

You've reached the capstone. You know how to build production Digital FTEs.
