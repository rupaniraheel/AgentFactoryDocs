### Core Concept
Before learning a technology, you first build a skill that embeds official documentation—this way, you own the knowledge from day one rather than absorbing it gradually.

### Key Mental Models
- **Skill-First Learning**: Build the tool before learning the theory—the skill becomes your guide through the chapter
- **Documentation-Grounded Knowledge**: Skills built from official docs are more reliable than assumptions or memory

### Critical Patterns
- Clone the skills-lab fresh for each chapter to avoid state assumptions
- Use a single prompt that invokes both skill-creator and context7 for documentation fetching
- Let Claude ask clarifying questions rather than specifying everything upfront

### Common Mistakes
- Trying to learn the SDK first and build a skill later (reverses the learning advantage)
- Using generic knowledge instead of fetching official documentation
- Skipping clarifying questions instead of engaging with Claude's requests

### Connections
- **Builds on**: Claude Code skills basics (Chapter 39 preview)
- **Leads to**: SDK setup and first agent (Lesson 1)
