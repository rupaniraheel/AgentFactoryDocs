# Hello Actors - Your First Actor

You understand the Actor Model from Lesson 1: actors encapsulate state and behavior, process messages one at a time, and communicate through asynchronous messages. Now it's time to build one.

In this lesson, you'll create a `HelloAgent` actor that stores greeting messages. Each user gets their own actor instance with isolated state. When user "alice" sends greetings, they're stored separately from user "bob's" greetings. This is the foundation for building AI agents where each conversation, each task, each user session has its own stateful actor.

By the end of this lesson, you'll have a working actor that:
- Accepts greeting messages and stores them in a history list
- Retrieves the greeting history on demand
- Limits history to the last 5 entries (memory efficiency)
- Persists state across actor deactivation and reactivation

## The Actor Creation Pattern

Building a Dapr actor requires four pieces working together:

```
1. Actor Interface        Define WHAT methods the actor exposes
       |
       v
2. Actor Implementation   Define HOW the actor behaves
       |
       v
3. Actor Registration     Connect actor to FastAPI via DaprActor
       |
       v
4. Actor Invocation       Call actor methods via ActorProxy
```

Let's build each piece.

## Step 1: Define the Actor Interface

The actor interface declares what methods your actor exposes. It's a contract that clients use to invoke the actor. In Python, you define it as an abstract base class extending `ActorInterface`:

```python
from dapr.actor import ActorInterface, actormethod

class HelloAgentInterface(ActorInterface):
    @actormethod(name="AddGreeting")
    async def add_greeting(self, greeting_data: dict) -> None:
        """Add a greeting to history."""
        ...

    @actormethod(name="GetGreetingHistory")
    async def get_greeting_history(self) -> list[dict] | None:
        """Retrieve greeting history."""
        ...
```

**Output:**
No output yet - this is just the interface definition. The `...` (ellipsis) is valid Python syntax for abstract method bodies.

### Naming Convention: Snake_Case vs PascalCase

Notice the dual naming:
- **Method name** in Python uses `snake_case`: `add_greeting`
- **Decorator name** uses `PascalCase`: `AddGreeting`

The decorator name is what external clients use when invoking the actor via HTTP or `ActorProxy`. The Python method name is what you use internally. This follows Dapr's convention across all SDKs.

```python
# When invoking from ActorProxy, use the decorator name:
await proxy.AddGreeting({"message": "Hello!"})  # PascalCase

# Inside the actor implementation, use the Python name:
async def add_greeting(self, greeting_data: dict):  # snake_case
```

## Step 2: Implement the Actor

The actor implementation extends both the `Actor` base class and your interface:

```python
from dapr.actor import Actor
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

class HelloAgent(Actor, HelloAgentInterface):
    def __init__(self, ctx, actor_id):
        super().__init__(ctx, actor_id)
        self._history_key = f"history-{actor_id.id}"

    async def _on_activate(self) -> None:
        """Called when actor is activated (first message or after GC)."""
        logging.info(f"Activating actor for {self._history_key}")
        try:
            history = await self._state_manager.get_state(self._history_key)
            if history is None:
                logging.info(f"State not found, initializing empty history")
                await self._state_manager.set_state(self._history_key, [])
            else:
                logging.info(f"Loaded existing history: {len(history)} items")
        except Exception as e:
            logging.warning(f"Non-critical error in _on_activate: {e}")
            await self._state_manager.set_state(self._history_key, [])

    async def add_greeting(self, greeting_data: dict) -> None:
        """Add a greeting to history, keeping last 5."""
        history = await self._state_manager.get_state(self._history_key)
        current_history = history if isinstance(history, list) else []
        current_history.append(greeting_data)

        # Limit to last 5 greetings
        if len(current_history) > 5:
            current_history = current_history[-5:]

        await self._state_manager.set_state(self._history_key, current_history)
        logging.info(f"Added greeting for {self._history_key}: {greeting_data}")

    async def get_greeting_history(self) -> list[dict] | None:
        """Retrieve greeting history."""
        history = await self._state_manager.get_state(self._history_key)
        return history if isinstance(history, list) else []
```

**Output:**
No direct output - this defines the class. When the actor is activated, you'll see log messages like:
```
INFO:root:Activating actor for history-alice
INFO:root:State not found, initializing empty history
```

### Key Implementation Details

**The `_state_manager`**: Every actor has a built-in state manager that persists data to the configured state store. You don't manage Redis connections - you just call `get_state()` and `set_state()`.

**The `_on_activate` lifecycle hook**: This runs when the actor is first invoked or when it's reactivated after being garbage-collected due to idleness. Use it to initialize default state.

**Unique state keys**: Each actor instance uses its own key (`history-{actor_id}`). Actor "alice" stores state under `history-alice`, actor "bob" under `history-bob`. Complete isolation.

**Error handling in `_on_activate`**: The try/except ensures the actor initializes even if state retrieval has issues. A robust actor shouldn't crash on activation.

## Step 3: Register the Actor with FastAPI

Now connect the actor to your FastAPI application using `DaprActor`:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from dapr.ext.fastapi import DaprActor
from dapr.actor import ActorProxy, ActorId

app = FastAPI(
    title="HelloAgentService",
    description="DACA Step 1: Dapr Actor Fundamentals"
)

# Add Dapr Actor Extension
actor = DaprActor(app)

@app.on_event("startup")
async def startup():
    """Register actor types on application startup."""
    await actor.register_actor(HelloAgent)
    logging.info(f"Registered actor: {HelloAgent.__name__}")
```

**Output:**
When the application starts, you'll see:
```
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:root:Registered actor: HelloAgent
```

### What DaprActor Does

`DaprActor(app)` adds several routes to your FastAPI application that Dapr uses internally:

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `GET /healthz` | Actor system health check |
| `GET /dapr/config` | Returns registered actor types and configuration |
| `POST /actors/{actorType}/{actorId}/method/{methodName}` | Method invocation (Dapr calls this) |

You don't call these endpoints directly - Dapr's sidecar does. But you can verify registration:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/dapr/config
```

**Output:**
```json
{
  "actorIdleTimeout": "1h0m0s0ms0us",
  "actorScanInterval": "0h0m30s0ms0us",
  "drainOngoingCallTimeout": "0h1m0s0ms0us",
  "drainRebalancedActors": true,
  "entitiesConfig": [],
  "entities": [
    "HelloAgent"
  ]
}
```

The `entities` array confirms `HelloAgent` is registered.

## Step 4: Invoke the Actor

Create FastAPI endpoints that invoke the actor using `ActorProxy`:

```python
@app.post("/greet/{actor_id}")
async def add_greeting(actor_id: str, greeting: dict):
    """Add a greeting to the actor's history."""
    proxy = ActorProxy.create("HelloAgent", ActorId(actor_id), HelloAgentInterface)
    await proxy.AddGreeting(greeting)
    return {"status": "Greeting added", "actor_id": actor_id}

@app.get("/greet/{actor_id}/history")
async def get_greeting_history(actor_id: str):
    """Retrieve the actor's greeting history."""
    proxy = ActorProxy.create("HelloAgent", ActorId(actor_id), HelloAgentInterface)
    history = await proxy.GetGreetingHistory()
    return {"actor_id": actor_id, "history": history}
```

**Output:**
After sending greetings:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/greet/alice \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Hello, World!"}'
```

Response:
```json
{"status": "Greeting added", "actor_id": "alice"}
```

Retrieving history:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/greet/alice/history
```

Response:
```json
{"actor_id": "alice", "history": [{"message": "Hello, World!"}]}
```

### ActorProxy Explained

```python
proxy = ActorProxy.create("HelloAgent", ActorId(actor_id), HelloAgentInterface)
```

This creates a client for communicating with a specific actor:
- `"HelloAgent"`: The actor type (must match registered name)
- `ActorId(actor_id)`: The unique identifier for this actor instance
- `HelloAgentInterface`: The interface for type-safe method calls

The proxy handles all communication with the Dapr sidecar. Your HTTP request to `/greet/alice` becomes an internal call through Dapr to the `HelloAgent` actor with ID "alice".

## Step 5: Configure the State Store

Actors need a state store with actor support enabled. Add this metadata to your state store component:

```yaml
# components/statestore.yaml
apiVersion: dapr.io/v1alpha1
kind: Component
metadata:
  name: statestore
  namespace: default
spec:
  type: state.redis
  version: v1
  metadata:
  - name: redisHost
    value: redis-master.default.svc.cluster.local:6379
  - name: redisPassword
    value: ""
  - name: actorStateStore
    value: "true"
```

**Output:**
No direct output - this is configuration. When applied, Dapr uses this state store for actor persistence.

### The Critical Setting: actorStateStore

The `actorStateStore: "true"` metadata is required for actors. Without it:
- Actor registration succeeds
- Actor invocation succeeds
- But state persistence fails silently

If your actor state isn't persisting, check this setting first.

### Verifying State in Redis

You can inspect actor state directly in Redis:

```bash
# Connect to Redis
kubectl exec -it redis-master -- redis-cli

# List actor keys
KEYS *HelloAgent*
```

**Output:**
```
1) "daca-ai-app||HelloAgent||alice||history-alice"
```

The key format is `{app-id}||{actor-type}||{actor-id}||{state-key}`.

```bash
# Get the state value
HGETALL "daca-ai-app||HelloAgent||alice||history-alice"
```

**Output:**
```
1) "data"
2) "[{\"message\": \"Hello, World!\"}]"
3) "version"
4) "1"
```

## Complete Working Example

Here's the full `main.py` combining all pieces:

```python
import logging
from fastapi import FastAPI
from dapr.ext.fastapi import DaprActor
from dapr.actor import Actor, ActorInterface, ActorProxy, ActorId, actormethod

# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

# FastAPI application
app = FastAPI(title="HelloAgentService", description="Dapr Actor Fundamentals")

# Add Dapr Actor Extension
actor = DaprActor(app)

# Define the actor interface
class HelloAgentInterface(ActorInterface):
    @actormethod(name="AddGreeting")
    async def add_greeting(self, greeting_data: dict) -> None:
        ...

    @actormethod(name="GetGreetingHistory")
    async def get_greeting_history(self) -> list[dict] | None:
        ...

# Implement the actor
class HelloAgent(Actor, HelloAgentInterface):
    def __init__(self, ctx, actor_id):
        super().__init__(ctx, actor_id)
        self._history_key = f"history-{actor_id.id}"

    async def _on_activate(self) -> None:
        logging.info(f"Activating actor for {self._history_key}")
        try:
            history = await self._state_manager.get_state(self._history_key)
            if history is None:
                await self._state_manager.set_state(self._history_key, [])
        except Exception as e:
            logging.warning(f"Non-critical error: {e}")
            await self._state_manager.set_state(self._history_key, [])

    async def add_greeting(self, greeting_data: dict) -> None:
        history = await self._state_manager.get_state(self._history_key)
        current_history = history if isinstance(history, list) else []
        current_history.append(greeting_data)
        if len(current_history) > 5:
            current_history = current_history[-5:]
        await self._state_manager.set_state(self._history_key, current_history)
        logging.info(f"Added greeting for {self._history_key}")

    async def get_greeting_history(self) -> list[dict] | None:
        history = await self._state_manager.get_state(self._history_key)
        return history if isinstance(history, list) else []

# Register the actor
@app.on_event("startup")
async def startup():
    await actor.register_actor(HelloAgent)
    logging.info(f"Registered actor: {HelloAgent.__name__}")

# FastAPI endpoints to invoke the actor
@app.post("/greet/{actor_id}")
async def add_greeting(actor_id: str, greeting: dict):
    proxy = ActorProxy.create("HelloAgent", ActorId(actor_id), HelloAgentInterface)
    await proxy.AddGreeting(greeting)
    return {"status": "Greeting added", "actor_id": actor_id}

@app.get("/greet/{actor_id}/history")
async def get_greeting_history(actor_id: str):
    proxy = ActorProxy.create("HelloAgent", ActorId(actor_id), HelloAgentInterface)
    history = await proxy.GetGreetingHistory()
    return {"actor_id": actor_id, "history": history}
```

## Testing the Actor

Run the application with Dapr:

```bash
# Start the application
tilt up
```

Then test with curl or the Swagger UI at `http://localhost:8000/docs`:

```bash
# Add greetings for user alice
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/greet/alice \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Hello!"}'

curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/greet/alice \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "How are you?"}'

# Get alice's history
curl http://localhost:8000/greet/alice/history

# Add greeting for user bob (separate actor)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/greet/bob \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Hi Bob!"}'

# Get bob's history (only his greetings)
curl http://localhost:8000/greet/bob/history
```

**Output:**
Alice's history:
```json
{"actor_id": "alice", "history": [{"message": "Hello!"}, {"message": "How are you?"}]}
```

Bob's history:
```json
{"actor_id": "bob", "history": [{"message": "Hi Bob!"}]}
```

Each actor ID creates a separate actor instance with isolated state.

## Common Errors and Solutions

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `ACTOR_TYPE_NOT_FOUND` | Actor not registered | Verify `register_actor()` in startup, check `/dapr/config` |
| `ACTOR_METHOD_NOT_FOUND` | Method not in interface | Add `@actormethod` decorator to interface |
| State not persisting | Missing `actorStateStore` | Add `actorStateStore: "true"` to state store component |
| `KeyError` on state access | State doesn't exist | Use `_on_activate` to initialize default state |

## Reflect on Your Skill

You extended your `dapr-deployment` skill in Lesson 0 to include actor patterns. Does it now cover the complete actor creation workflow?

### Test Your Skill

```
Using my dapr-deployment skill, generate a complete actor that tracks user
preferences with get_preference and set_preference methods. Include the
interface, implementation, registration, and invocation code.
```

Does your skill produce:
- An interface with `@actormethod` decorators using proper naming?
- An implementation with `_on_activate` for state initialization?
- Registration with `DaprActor(app)` and `register_actor()`?
- Invocation endpoints using `ActorProxy.create()`?

### Identify Gaps

If the generated code is missing pieces:
- Interface without `@actormethod` decorators
- Implementation without `_on_activate` hook
- Missing state manager usage
- ActorProxy with wrong parameter order

### Improve Your Skill

```
My dapr-deployment skill generated incomplete actor code. Update it to include:
- The complete actor creation pattern (interface -> implementation -> registration -> invocation)
- Proper @actormethod decorator with name parameter
- The _on_activate lifecycle hook with state initialization
- ActorProxy.create() with correct parameters: type, id, interface
```

## Try With AI

Open your AI companion and work through these scenarios collaboratively.

### Prompt 1: Build Your First Actor

```
Help me create a HelloAgent actor that stores greeting messages. I need:
1. An actor interface with AddGreeting and GetGreetingHistory methods
2. An implementation that limits history to the last 5 greetings
3. FastAPI registration with DaprActor
4. HTTP endpoints to invoke the actor

Walk me through each piece and explain the naming convention difference
between Python method names (snake_case) and @actormethod names (PascalCase).
```

**What you're learning:** The complete actor creation workflow from interface definition to invocation. The AI helps you understand why each piece exists and how they connect.

### Prompt 2: Debug a Registration Problem

```
I created my HelloAgent actor but I'm getting ACTOR_TYPE_NOT_FOUND when I
invoke it. Here's my code:

[paste your registration code]

Help me debug this. What should I check in:
1. The startup registration
2. The /dapr/config endpoint
3. The Dapr sidecar logs
```

**What you're learning:** Systematic debugging of actor registration issues. The AI teaches you the diagnostic endpoints and log patterns that reveal registration problems.

### Prompt 3: Extend with Timestamps

```
I want to extend my HelloAgent to track timestamps with each greeting. The
greeting data should include the message and the time it was added.

But I'm concerned about JSON serialization - datetime objects don't serialize
directly. Show me how to:
1. Add timestamps safely using ISO format strings
2. Verify the data serializes correctly to Redis
3. Display timestamps in a readable format when retrieving history
```

**What you're learning:** State serialization considerations for actors. The AI helps you understand that actor state must be JSON-serializable and shows patterns for handling complex data types.

### Safety Note

The `@actormethod` decorator name must be unique within an actor type. If you use the same decorator name for different methods, invocations will route unpredictably. Always verify your decorator names are distinct and meaningful. When working with AI to generate actor code, validate that the generated `@actormethod` names don't conflict with existing methods in your codebase.
