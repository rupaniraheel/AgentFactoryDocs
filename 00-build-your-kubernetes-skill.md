# Build Your Kubernetes Skill

Before learning Kubernetes—orchestrating your containerized applications at scale—you'll **own** a Kubernetes skill.

---

## Step 1: Get the Skills Lab

1. Go to [github.com/panaversity/claude-code-skills-lab](https://github.com/panaversity/claude-code-skills-lab)
2. Click the green **Code** button
3. Select **Download ZIP**
4. Extract the ZIP file
5. Open the extracted folder in your terminal

```bash
cd claude-code-skills-lab
claude
```

---

## Step 2: Create Your Skill

Copy and paste this prompt:

```
Using your skill creator skill create a new skill for Kubernetes. I will use
it to deploy and scale containerized applications from hello world to professional
production systems. Use context7 skill to study official documentation and then
build it so no self assumed knowledge.
```

Claude will:
1. Fetch official Kubernetes documentation via Context7
2. Ask you clarifying questions (resource limits, scaling patterns, health checks)
3. Create the complete skill with references and templates

Your skill appears at `.claude/skills/kubernetes-deployment/`.

---

## Done

You now own a Kubernetes skill built from official documentation. The rest of this chapter teaches you what it knows—and how to make it better.
